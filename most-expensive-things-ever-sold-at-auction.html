                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">While there’s no shortage of amazing things in our world, the lengths people would go and the money they’d spend to own them never ceases to amaze. In this day and age, it’s easy to sell off your unwanted items and to put them out there for the world to bid on. Sometimes, the paydays from these auctions are enormous, and for a good reason. Here we’ll see many things, from super rare baseball cards to the biggest coin ever made! Here we’ll see the Most Expensive Things Ever Sold at Auction!<br /><br />Learn about the BIGGEST of everything Monday, Wednesday, and Friday just subscribe!<br /><br /><br />6. Largest Gold Coin in the World!<br />A gigantic 100 kg (220.5 lbs) Canadian gold maple leaf coin was bought in an auction in Vienna by a Spanish precious metals company for £2.7 million. The coin was one of just five Canadian $1,000,000 Maple Leaf coins that were produced by the Royal Canadian Mint. AvW Invest, an Austrian investment group, ordered the auction after filing for insolvency and having its owner and chief executive arrested on breach of trust, suspicion of fraud, and other charges. The coin was launched in 2007 in an attempt at snagging the Guinness World Record for world’s largest coin and to show off the production facilities of the Royal Canadian Mint. It’s 99.999% pure.<br /><br /><br />5. A Whole Bunch of Meteorites<br />Rob Elliot, a former electronics engineer, built a collection of meteorites over a period of 13 years and finally decided to part ways with it in 2009. His collection was over 1,000 pieces strong, but he decided to sell only 170 of the space rocks. His interest started when he saw an ad in a magazine for a meteorite for $40, and ever since, he’s been scouring the globe for his own. They went on sale in Edinburgh at Lyon and Turnbull, and auctioneers put a $1.6 million price tag on the whole lot. He decided to sell the meteorites because although he has a great interest, he figured someone else could make better use of them. The entire bundle ended up selling for $1.4 million.<br /><br /><br /><br />4. The Dentures of Winston Churchill<br />While a lot of people with speech impediments will go to great lengths to cover them up, Winston Churchill knew that his made him recognizable and himself. He had his dentures specially made to preserve that lisp so that he was instantly recognized during his wartime radio broadcasts. Derek Cudlipp, a young dental technician, designed and created Churchill’s dentures and kept a set in his family’s home until 2010. Churchill appreciated Cudlipp’s work so much that when he was drafted for the war, Churchill himself tore up the papers. He told Cudlipp that he’d be more critical to the war effort if he stayed at home and repaired the dentures, which needed fixing quite often. When he’d get angry, Churchill would flick them out and fling them across the room, so Cudlipp was kept reasonably busy. The set from Cudlipp’s home sold for £15,200 (USD 19,417).<br /><br /><br /><br />3. Honus Wagner Baseball Card<br />Honus Wagner was a German-American baseball player who played 21 seasons at shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He was one of the first five players ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and is still considered one of the best baseball players of all time. So it makes sense that his baseball card would be pretty popular, right? Well, he made them even rarer when after the American Tobacco Company (ATC) put out his card among the cards of many other players. Wagner quickly made sure to get the production of his card stopped, whether because he wanted more compensation or because he didn’t want children to have to buy cigarettes to get his card, no one knows. Therefore, only between 50 and 200 of his cards were produced, compared to the “tens or hundreds of thousands” produced for other players. Most recently, in 2016, a T206 Wagner was auctioned by Goldin Auctions and ended up selling online for $3.12 million.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2. Lunch With Warren Buffet<br />So, every year for 19 years, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, has auctioned a lunch with himself, and every year he’s raised a lot of money doing so. He uses the auction as a way to raise money for Glide, which is an organization that fights poverty in San Francisco, California. Over the years, the auctions have raised more than $26 million, and in 2018, the winning bid was $3.3 million. But that’s not the most money anyone’s ever paid to have lunch with the octogenarian. In fact, in both 2012 and 2016, two different high bidders paid $3,456,789 to eat with Buffett. Both years both bidders paid that exact amount, whether by coincidence or on purpose. We’re guessing on purpose; we mean, 3456789… come on!<br /><br />1...
