You may even be aware that you are enabling addiction.<br /><br />Whether you're new to dealing with a person struggling with addiction or frustrated because you've tried everything with no success, listen to Candace Plattor, Addictions Therapist and recovering addict of 29 years. <br /><br />Addicts are good at staying addicted and enablers are their insurance policy that allows the problem staying in place. The loved one MUST start his/her own enabling recovery. Candace reveals the steps to giving up enabling and start helping an addict recover. It's a counter intuitive process that requires help to be successful.
