{% raw %}#awakeningprajna #pain body<br />Allowing for the Pain Body<br />Allowing Yourself to Experience Discomfort <br />‚Ä¢ this is the widest doorway to remaining present to the pain body and allowing it to discharge, dissolve. <br />A handy tip for becoming more free of pain-body that is often associated with early trauma.<br />‚Ä¢ Pause, relax open to notice discomfort and the energy that wants to fight, jump, engage with negative thought patterns.<br />‚Ä¢ Decide not to hook in and identify with this energy. Let yourself feel discomfort.<br />‚Ä¢ Choose not to be a host for it to feed on<br />‚Ä¢ Become comfortable with the toxic field that may be activated so it can move through you, transmute and empty.<br />‚Ä¢ Continue to widen and notice a natural wellspring of restorative calm and quiet that implodes the emotional body field when you do not feed the pain body argument.<br />‚Ä¢ Root and anchor in the still, calm openness of your true self.<br /><br />ü¶ã   SUBSCRIBE<br />üëç   Like, Share this video.
