{% raw %}From doctor’s offices to detox diets, the word ‘wellness’ has become commonplace, yet it’s widespread use is riddled with misconceptions and conflicting opinions as to what it truly means. Meanwhile, people continue to experience deteriorating physical and mental health, increasingly stressful living conditions, unrealistic societal expectations, and a growing disconnect from realizing their full potential and innate purpose. The time has come to evolve from simply surviving day-to-day life to truly thriving in all facets of life—physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually and socially. And the fact of the matter is, the most current science validates what many thought leaders have long believed to be true—that cultivating the conditions for positive health and high-level wellness is ultimately an inside job.
