I make short, to-the-point online math tutorials. I struggled with math growing up and have been able to use those experiences to help students improve in math through practical applications and tips.<br /><br />If I helped you in this video, I would love to have you subscribe. My subscribers are my students and there is nothing more than to see you be successful.<br />Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2z813ow">http://bit.ly/2z813ow</a><br /><br />I believe everyone can learn math and it doesn't have to be a struggle. There are three things everyone learning math needs. A belief you can learn math, deliberate practice and a coach for guidance.<br /><br />For a list of all my videos in organized playlist please visit my website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.freemathvideos.com">http://www.freemathvideos.com</a><br /><br />If you are looking to take your learning to the next level by then I have created multiple courses on Udemy for you as well.
