As option trading gains more popularity a lot of beginner traders are focusing more on how to pick stocks and find options, rather than utilizing a trading strategy to give them structure. I go over 3 simple steps that can help any new or advanced option trader and how regardless if you pick the best stocks or not, this trading strategy can still help you get exposure to the market every week. It is very simple and we have talked about it a lot, but when it is all said and done this approach is not only simple, but provides its own trading rules that helps beginner traders avoid easy mistakes. In essence it is basically a strict risk management approach that slows the game down. I hope this helps, if you have any questions let me know in the comments or see you on the live trading stream!<br /><br /><br />How to pick stocks for your long term portfolio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VzDJ6CsDe0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VzDJ6CsDe0</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE &amp; LIKE for more videos COMMENT below if you have any questions and I will respond or make a video! <br /><br />#Stocks #Investing #Trading<br /><br />If you haven't done so follow me on social media!
