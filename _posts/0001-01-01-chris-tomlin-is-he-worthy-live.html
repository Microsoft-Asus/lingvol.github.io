(We do)<br />Do you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)<br />But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? (We do)<br />Do you wish that you could see it all made new? (We do)<br /><br />Is all creation groaning? (It is)<br />Is a new creation coming? (It is)<br />Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (It is)<br />Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? (It is)<br /><br />Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?<br />Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?<br />The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave<br />He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave<br /><br />Is He worthy? Is He worthy<br />Of all blessing and honor and glory?<br />Is He worthy of this?<br />He is<br /><br />Does the Father truly love us? (He does)<br />Does the Spirit move among us? (He does)<br />And does Jesus, our Messiah, hold forever those He loves? (He does)<br />Does our God intend to dwell again with us? (He does)<br /><br />Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?<br />Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?<br />The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave<br />He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave<br /><br />From every people and tribe (People and tribe)<br />Every nation and tongue (Every nation and tongue)<br />He has made us a kingdom and priests to God<br />To reign with the Son<br /><br />Is He worthy? Is He worthy<br />Of all blessing and honor and glory?<br />Is He worthy? Is He worthy?<br />Is He worthy of this?<br /><br />He is, He is<br />Is He worthy? Is He worthy?<br />He is, He is<br />He is worthy, He is worthy<br />He is<br /><br />Music video by Chris Tomlin performing Is He Worthy? (Live).
