We were really lucky with the time for the contest,<br />as we had a planned Studio visit in the first 2 weeks of August, for our debut cd. Thus we decided to enter in the 2nd Song contest, after we were one of the winners last time. We knew we had to top our last entry, which resulted in a lot of pressure. But after some songwriting sessions we agreed to theme the song around the Pirates of the League, ahead of all,<br />Gangplank, the Captain. The last week was quite stressful, all of us were either running around in Pirate costumes, recording their Instruments, cutting the Video or asleep. <br />But it is done now. And we are happy with the result. Enjoy!<br /><br />We have already started working on the Making of Video.<br /><br />Homepage: www.cravingforchaos.com<br />Music Video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swi9S7eqytM<br />Last year's winner: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATAlaOIEeVU<br /><br />Video editing: washed &amp; schlaum<br />Song &amp; Lyrics written by: Craving for Chaos (Moni, Steff, Beni, Jeremy, Schlaum)<br />Recorded at: Deliriums Dawn Studio (www.delirium-site.de)<br /><br />cheers &amp; thanks for the help to:<br /><br />washed for filming, cutting and spending a lot of time on this project (and singing in the mighty pirate choir)<br />Phil (rowing and singing in the mighty pirate choir)<br />Ludl (singing in the mighty pirate choir)<br />Tom  (singing in the mighty pirate choir)<br />Deliriums Dawn (check out their awesome music &amp; studio www.delirium-site.de)<br />Mona (washed's gf) for enduring 2 nerds working on a video for several days while repeatedly listening to the same song, and still supplying food (AGAIN!)<br /><br /><br />Bummelbaer<br />DaVyse<br />eqkl1pse<br />OKaisla<br />Dorien<br />wlk Narrentod<br />wlk Drunken<br /><br />...always fun to play with you guys!
