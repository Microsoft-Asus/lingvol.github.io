{% raw %}You may have already watched our video about pharmacology and drugs, but if not, letâ€™s recap. What is a drug? A drug is a substance that when released into the body will cause an effect. <br /><br />Some are legal, some are illegal and some are prescribed by doctors to treat illnesses. Whether a drug is legal or not, or can be bought without a prescription, varies by country. Recreational drugs are substances that people choose to take, like for example nicotine (in tobacco), alcohol, or coca leaves in the Andes. In this video, you are going to learn about two different types of drugs and their effects on the body.<br /><br />CREDITS<br />Animation &amp; Design: Waldi Apollis<br />Narration: Dale Bennett<br />Script: Bethan Parry &amp; Helen Stamp<br /><br />VISIT US<br />Website: www.fuseschool.org<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fuseSchool">https://twitter.com/fuseSchool</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fuseschool/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/fuseschool/?hl=en</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/fuseschool">http://www.facebook.com/fuseschool</a><br /><br />This Open Educational Resource is free of charge, under a Creative Commons License: Attribution-NonCommercial CC BY-NC.
