BUY &quot;GET BETTER&quot; - proceeds go to the Endometriosis Foundation of America and the Endometriosis Coalition  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/get-better-single/1455612480">https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/get-better-single/1455612480</a><br /><br />I wrote this song when I was in extreme pain from my endometriosis. I decided to put it out after being inspired from Endometriosis Awareness Month. The proceeds of this song are going to two of my favorite foundations for Endometriosis - the Endometriosis Foundation of America and The Endometriosis Coalition.<br /><br /> I am incredibly blessed in the fact that my journey with this disease, while it’s been rough, has been doable thanks to great doctors, support and being able to afford unconventional treatments. Anyone with endometriosis can tell you how expensive it all ends up being and I want to help people fight in any way I can. <br /><br />This is the most vulnerable I have ever been. I am scared, but I am empowered knowing maybe some of these words can help someone going through their chronic illness. <br /><br />LYRICS AND MUSIC: Leslie Mosier <br />MUSIC AND PRODUCING: Rob Chianelli <br />MIXING: Kara Madden and Reid Stefan <br /><br />VIDEO DIRECTING AND EDITING: Rob Chianelli <br /><br /><br />Who was I before this <br />Will I make it through <br />The pain is slowly creeping <br />’Til there’s nothing I can do <br /><br />My body in a circle <br />Clouds fill up my eyes <br />I wait for it to kick in <br />So the hurt can be disguised <br /><br />Breathing just feels harder <br />Down I go again <br /><br />CHORUS <br />//<br />Wake up, put on the makeup <br />And smile, for the camera <br />Work hard, make money <br />Maybe that will make me feel alright <br /><br />No one really knows what you’re going through <br />But they pretend to <br />Say they’re thinking about you <br /><br />I’m fine, I’ll be alright <br />I just wanna <br />Get Better <br />// <br /><br />I feel like I’m a burden <br />A liability <br />But who am I to give a damn <br />When my own body turned on me <br /><br />Keep pushing on to see better days <br />Even when it hurts <br />I’m not defined by the times I’ve cried <br />Or fallen to the dirt <br /><br />Breathing just feels harder <br />Down I go again <br /><br />CHORUS <br />//<br />Wake up, put on the makeup <br />And smile, for the camera <br />Work hard, make money <br />Maybe that will make me feel alright <br /><br />No one really knows what you’re going through <br />But they pretend to <br />Say they’re thinking about you <br /><br />I’m fine, I’ll be alright <br />I just wanna <br />Get Better <br />// <br /><br /><br />Here I go here I go here I go again <br />I’m at war with my body, my closest friend <br />I’ve been broken I’ve been down got up in the end<br />Here I go here I go here I go again <br /><br />CHORUS <br />//<br />Wake up, put on the makeup <br />And smile, for the camera <br />Work hard, make money <br />Maybe that will make me feel alright <br /><br />No one really knows what you’re going through <br />But they pretend to <br />Say they’re thinking about you <br /><br />I’m fine, I’ll be alright <br />I just wanna <br />Get Better <br />//
