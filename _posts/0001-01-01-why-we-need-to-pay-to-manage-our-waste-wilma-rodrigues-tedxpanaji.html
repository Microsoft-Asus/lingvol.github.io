Garbage and waste management is a big challenge in front of todayâ€™s hyper consumerist world. Our current models of waste management, especially in a country like India are exploitative, opines Wilma Rodrigues, a professional waste manager and entrepreneur. In this talk she presents before us a successful waste management model that has both a head and a heart. A former journalist turned 'socialpreneur', Wilma Rodrigues is the founder &amp; CEO of Saahas Zero Waste, a social enterprise that provides end-to-end waste management. Wilma is an expert at managing decentralized waste management centers, collection, storage and working with recyclers for different waste streams including e-Waste. The desire to be a solution provider for waste related issues made her start Saahas, a NGO in 2001. Saahas has been recognized as one of the top 12 Social Enterprises in India by NDTV and today manages 53 tonnes of waste across India. Its focus is on implementing zero waste campuses for bulk waste generators such as manufacturers, hotels, schools, offices and more. Currently, Saahas effectively collects waste from multiple collection partners, aggregates it, and then dispatches the same to various recyclers; forming a well-oiled waste management model. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
