We hosted an exclusive Generations of Warmth event at the Haus de Kunst in Munich. We showcased Goose Person Ben Saunders, his stories and holiday traditions, as well as products from our FW18 collections for guests to experience and discover themselves. Guests were invited to share their own stories of warmth and tradition, while spending family time in our holiday themed photobooth.  #GenerationsofWarmth #CGxMunich
