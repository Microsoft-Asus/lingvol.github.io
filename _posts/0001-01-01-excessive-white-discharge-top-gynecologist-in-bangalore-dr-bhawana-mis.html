This women's day, learn about the excessive white discharge with our expert Dr. Bhawana Mishra, Sr. Consultant - Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology at Aster RV Hospital, JP Nagar. <br /><br />A bit of white discharge, especially at the beginning or end of your menstrual cycle, is normal. However, if the discharge is accompanied by itching and has a thick, cottage cheese-like consistency or appearance, it's not normal and needs treatment. This type of discharge may be a sign of a yeast infection.<br />Increased vaginal discharge can be caused by normal menstrual cycle changes, vaginal infection, or cancer (rare). If a woman has more than her usual amount of vaginal discharge, she may need to see her healthcare provider. If a woman has discharge plus itching or burning near the vagina, she may have vaginitis.<br /><br />Dr Bhawana Mishra is a senior consultant in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Aster RV Hospital, Bengaluru.
