Britain’s Sam Winterburn is a regular of the 2019 World Enduro Super Series. Riding for Eurotek KTM, but recently switching to Triple D Motorsport, Winterburn has long looked forward to the Hawkstone Park Cross-Country. And following a season’s best Silver class runner-up result at Red Bull Romaniacs, the young Brit is more confident than ever and ready to do battle at his home round of the series.<br /><br />A former Motocross rider, Sam has shown impressive strength and determination this season. At round one in Portugal he placed a commendable 35th, before improving to 32nd the following weekend in the mud and rain of Trèfle Lozérien AMV.<br /><br />Admitting to lacking in the Trials experience needed when tackling the most severe obstacles at the Erzbergrodeo Red Bull Hare Scramble, he bounced back from a 53rd place result to go 27 positions higher and finish 26th at Spain’s Hixpania Hard Enduro.<br /><br />Check him: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/samwinterburn/">https://www.instagram.com/samwinterburn/</a><br /><br /><br />Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheDirtbikeRider">https://www.facebook.com/TheDirtbikeRider</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/TheDirtbikeRiderofficial">https://instagram.com/TheDirtbikeRiderofficial</a><br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/TheDirtbikeRider1994">https://youtube.com/TheDirtbikeRider1994</a><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------◀ IMPORTANT ▶ ---------------------<br /><br />There is no copyright infringement intended for this video,all authors can be found here below.
