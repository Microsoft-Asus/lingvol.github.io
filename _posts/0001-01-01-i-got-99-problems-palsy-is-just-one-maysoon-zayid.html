{% raw %}&quot;I have cerebral palsy. I shake all the time,&quot; Maysoon Zayid announces at the beginning of this exhilarating, hilarious talk. (Really, it's hilarious.) &quot;I'm like Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.&quot; With grace and wit, the Arab-American comedian takes us on a whistle-stop tour of her adventures as an actress, stand-up comic, philanthropist and advocate for the disabled.<br /><br />TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and much more.<br />Find closed captions and translated subtitles in many languages at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ted.com/translate">http://www.ted.com/translate</a><br /><br />Follow TED news on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/tednews">http://www.twitter.com/tednews</a><br />Like TED on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TED">https://www.facebook.com/TED</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector">http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector</a>{% endraw %}
