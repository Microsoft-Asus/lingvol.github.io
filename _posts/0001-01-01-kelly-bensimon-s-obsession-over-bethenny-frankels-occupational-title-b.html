{% raw %}Kelly Bensimon gets vicious on a trip with the other housewives. She can't seem to let go of grudges from last year where Bethenny called her &quot;madonna&quot;. So she is determined to ruin this bachelorette trip that Ramona was so kind as to invite her on. She continually attacks Bethenny the entire time she is there, then projects and in her delusions imagines it was actually the other women attacking her. This is one segment of the clip compilations I have coming - focusing on her obsession over whether or not Bethenny is actually a chef.{% endraw %}
