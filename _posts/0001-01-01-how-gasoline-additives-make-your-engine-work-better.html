Passenger vehicles continuously become more sophisticated to meet changing emissions regulations, improve fuel economy, and meet consumer performance demands. Engines become more complicated with modern engine designs.<br /><br />It's no surprise that today's more sophisticated components require more sophisticated fuels. All gasoline is not the same. Not even close, actually. The quality of gasolines on the market today can vary dramatically.
