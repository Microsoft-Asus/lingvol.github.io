{% raw %}Do you rinse your roots every morning or shampoo once a week? On this weekâ€™s episode of #TheGlowUp, Beauty Director Jenny Jin asks the age old question: How often should we really be washing our hair? To set the record straight, Jin checks in with celeb hairstylist and Co-Founder of Act and Acre, Helen Reavey, who uses a microscopic camera to inspect our scalps (and the results are alarming). Watch as Reavey probes our strands, demystifies hair oil and yes, tells us exactly how often we should lather up.<br /><br />Our friends at Act and Acre are giving away an Essentials kit (hello, healthy hair and scalp!)
