{% raw %}Combining the alluring freedom of both tiny house living and life on the water, this tiny floating house boat is an incredible alternative living solution. <br /><br />Become a Living Big Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/livingbig">https://www.patreon.com/livingbig</a><br /><br />Designed by Ian Ugarte in collaboration with architect Drew Heath, this tiny house boat, named the Arkiboat, was designed to be strong and lightweight, designed for a life at sea with open views to the surrounding environment, all with an architectural edge. <br /><br />You can find our more about this tiny home on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/life-on--water-tiny-house-boat/">http://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/life-on--water-tiny-house-boat/</a><br /><br />This small home is designed to be a fully functioning boat. It can travel at a decent speed and is comfortable for full time live-aboard life. It can be moored either on a swing mooring, or at a marina and is completely self contained with all the normal holding tanks. It's also completely off-the-grid, generating it's power from a solar system on the roof and capitalising on Australia's high sunshine hours. <br /><br />Follow us on Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/livingbiginatinyhouse/">http://www.facebook.com/livingbiginatinyhouse/</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter: @TinyHouseNZ<br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: @livingbiginatinyhouse<br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos on tiny houses, DIY, design, and sustainable, off-grid living.<br /><br />Music in this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston">http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston</a><br /><br />'Living Big in a Tiny House' Â© 2018 Zyia Pictures Ltd{% endraw %}
