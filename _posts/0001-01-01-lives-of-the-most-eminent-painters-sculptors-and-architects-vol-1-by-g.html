Its influence is situated mainly in three domains: as an example for contemporary and later biographers and art historians, as a defining factor in the view on the Renaissance and the role of Florence and Rome in it, and as a major source of information on the lives and works of early Italian artists.(Summary by Wikipedia)<br /><br /><br /><br />More information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://librivox.org/lives-of-the-most-eminent-painters-sculptors-and-architects-vol-1-by-giorgio-vasari/">http://librivox.org/lives-of-the-most-eminent-painters-sculptors-and-architects-vol-1-by-giorgio-vasari/</a>
