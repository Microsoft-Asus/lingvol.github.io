This video is about common mental disorders. These mental disorders are very common and often go undiagnosed because there aren't very many noticeable symptoms. Even if you do not have any of these disorders, the video is still pretty funny.<br />y'all, I worked really hard on this video. Harder than I have ever worked on a video before. I think it has paid off though! I am very proud of this video. I this it is going to be more entertaining than my other videos. Hope y'all enjoy!<br /><br />Drawing tablet that i use- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2wRJlt7">https://amzn.to/2wRJlt7</a><br />hand sanitizer- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3as6PDH">https://amzn.to/3as6PDH</a><br />Microphone that i use (blue yeti)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UstxpJ">https://amzn.to/2UstxpJ</a><br /><br />Jackson spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uBHJmGEm5Xw2yaMy160RN?si=4w_OJxELSgSTXTPh7NjUYg">https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uBHJmGEm5Xw2yaMy160RN?si=4w_OJxELSgSTXTPh7NjUYg</a><br /><br />Jackson soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/fathertrees">https://soundcloud.com/fathertrees</a><br /><br />Jackson apple music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jackson/1443375385">https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jackson/1443375385</a><br /><br />my upload playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1iZ3amYm_d4zTFqrcNQdGHW7UBbvn8DT">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1iZ3amYm_d4zTFqrcNQdGHW7UBbvn8DT</a>
