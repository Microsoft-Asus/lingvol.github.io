{% raw %}Harry and Meghan really want people to take them seriously, they are trying so hard to make a Royal Family version of the Real Monarchy in Great Britain. I can't help but give my true feelings about what I see and I wish they would do better but I don't think it will happen. They seriously need to stop trying so hard to get people to listen to them and search deep about what really matters and more importantly about what they truly stand for, because I don't they even know what they stand for. They are lost and need help, Harry and Archie will pay the price for Meghan Markle's selfish ways for a monarchy rule splinter in America. <br /><br /><br /><br />**DISCLAIMER I AM NOT A JOURNALIST.
