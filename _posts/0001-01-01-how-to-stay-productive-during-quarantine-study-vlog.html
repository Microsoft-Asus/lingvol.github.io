hey guys! thank you for all the love on my last video :) here is another study vlog, but with a twist hehe. I tried my best to be as authentic, transparent and helpful as I can, so I showed you guys how I incorporate these tips into an actual study routine! <br /><br />while quarantine may have us feeling unmotivated, I hope my videos will help you guys bring some energy and productivity back into your daily routines :) <br /><br />_____<br />Social Media: <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/studychaii/">https://www.instagram.com/studychaii/</a>
