Dirty Channels vs Danny Russell 'Watchin' Out' is a horn-fuelled lesson in peak time energy; working a relentless groove before dropping into a hook that you'll be hearing a lot of this Summer. It's already gained plaudits, left,right and centre, including house single of the month in the July issue of Mixmag and DJ support from Jeremy Underground, Dan Shake, Gilles Peterson, Josh Wink, DJ Haus, Jimpster, Jacques Renault, DJ Boring, Nyra (Canoe Recordings), Adryiano, Mella Dee, Jimmy Rouge (Orange Tree Edits) and Red Rack'em.<br /><br />Artist: Dirty Channels vs Danny Russell <br />Title: Watchin Out<br />Label: Athens Of The North<br />Format: Vinyl 12&quot; + digital<br />Cat#: AOTN12005<br />Genre: House - Disco<br />Digital Release: 13th July 2018<br />Physical Release: 27th June 2018
