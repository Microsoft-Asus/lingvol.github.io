{% raw %}Our submitter, a hopeful, happy and loving character was excited to find out she had finally reached womanhood, only to discover she would be passing chunks and feeling extreme ovulation pains. <br /><br />She had convinced herself that this was a normal thing that every woman felt.. but that was her biggest mistake and the beginning of all her problems. After being misdiagnosed countless times by the doctors and placed on endless medication, she was thrown into a mental hospital because no one believed her. But the pain didn't stop there... even after her release she was ridiculed by all her friends until she was forced to just live with the pain. Thankfully in her later years, she did some research and came across a Facebook page about Endometriosis. She was able to learn a lot about the condition, surrounding herself with a wonderful group of supporting, strong women to help her diagnose and manage her condition. <br /><br />We chose this story because we believe these conditions cannot go unnoticed. 10% of women worldwide have endometriosis - thatâ€™s 176 million globally, with infertility rates as high as 30-50%. We encourage you to not ignore your symptoms and to go see your local GP,  and always get a second opinion if needed. We hope that this can raise awareness around this topic and help women build a better future for themselves!<br /><br />Like this kind of content?!
