MIT grad shows how to factor quadratic expressions. If you want to skip to the shortcut method, jump to 5:06. Nancy formerly of MathBFF explains the steps.<br /><br />Follow Nancy on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/nancypi">https://instagram.com/nancypi</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nancypi">https://twitter.com/nancypi</a><br /><br />The shortcut method (&quot;The Magic X&quot;) helps you factor any tough quadratic that doesn't begin with x^2 but instead begins with 2x^2 or 3x^2, or 4x^2, etc.<br /><br />1) IF YOUR QUADRATIC STARTS WITH X^2: It is faster to use the normal method for factoring in this case: trial and error. Say you have x^2 + 4x - 12. You need to find two numbers that multiply to the last number, -12, AND that add to the second coefficient, positive 4. First make a list of all pairs of numbers that multiply to -12. Then check which pair also adds to positive 4. Use the two numbers in this pair to write your factors.<br /><br />2) IF YOUR QUADRATIC STARTS WITH 2X^2 OR 3X^2 OR 4X^2, ETC:<br />A) First check whether your leading coefficient (2 or 3 or 4, etc) is just an overall constant that you can factor out of every term in the quadratic. If it is, factor it out first and then use Method #1 above to factor the X^2 expression that remains.<br />B) If your leading coefficient cannot be factored out evenly from every term, it will be faster and easier to use the shortcut &quot;magic X&quot; method instead of Method #1. See this method explained at time 5:06 in this video.<br /><br />For how to SOLVE QUADRATIC EQUATIONS by factoring, jump to the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Z5MnP9da4EM">https://youtu.be/Z5MnP9da4EM</a><br /><br />For more of my math videos, check out: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nancypi.com">http://nancypi.com</a>
