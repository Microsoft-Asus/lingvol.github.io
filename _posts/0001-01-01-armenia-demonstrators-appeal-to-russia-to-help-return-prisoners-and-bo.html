A capable authority that can solve the problem of exchanging prisoners of war, negotiating, whether with an ally or with and enemy.

A capable authority that can solve the problem of prisoner swap, negotiating, whether with an ally or with an enemy. And in this situation we are trying somehow, all people who are not indifferent, people from creative professions, including helping to make the voice of the parents of dead soldiers and officers, prisoners of war heard.&quot;<br /><br />SOT, Tatiana Shakaryan, Yerevan resident (Russian): &quot;This is my hero, in the name of this face, this name, I think my people will win. My nation has not lost, my nation has always been invincible. I am simply asking my compatriots, my Russians, I am half Russian, I am really asking my people, my Russian people, bring back those people who are alive.&quot;<br /><br />SOT, Mger Mkrtchyan, film director (Russian): &quot;Dear Sergey Pavlovich [Kopyrkin], we are artists, scientists, athletes and representatives of other fields of activity who are deeply concerned about what is happening. We, the citizens of Armenia, address you with a request. Mr. Kopyrkin, the trilateral agreement, signed on 10 November this year between Armenia, Russia and Azerbaijan, stated that the process of exchanging prisoners of war, civilians who have been taken as captives, and the bodies of the dead was underway. This is stated in the eighth paragraph of the agreement, where, unfortunately, no deadlines or dates are specified. After more than two weeks, the exchange of prisoners of war was never carried out, as the Azerbaijani side is constantly hindering this process and the exchange of bodies is very slow.&quot;<br /><br />SOT, Mger Mkrtchyan, film director (Russian): &quot;Dear Sergey Pavlovich [Kopyrkin]. We address you with a persuading request to intervene in this process personally, as well as to convey our appeal to the leadership of the Russian Federation. This will undoubtedly help speed up the return of our captive soldiers and civilians to their homeland.&quot;<br /><br />Video ID: 20201129-017<br /><br /><br />Video on Demand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ruptly.tv">http://www.ruptly.tv</a><br /><br />Contact: cd@ruptly.tv<br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Ruptly">http://twitter.com/Ruptly</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly">http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly</a>
