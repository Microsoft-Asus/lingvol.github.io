Hey Guys!!!<br /><br />I don't know about you but I know I want to live as long as possible. Growing up I always had the misconception that living longer meant things like taking your vitamins and having a 6 pack. I thought this because of the amount of misinformation given to us by marketers and IKA experts (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gLDQr9i7LkM).">https://youtu.be/gLDQr9i7LkM).</a> Being healthy is a lifestyle choice.<br /><br />I talk to my patients, friends, and family every day about how to live longer and I wanted to talk to you guys about it as well. That's why I was so excited to see that this Harvard study came out and did a great job breaking down how lifestyle habits played into life extension. (links below).<br /><br />Now it's important to note that these 5 healthy lifestyle habits are not the only habits that extend life nor are they proven to be the ones that extend life to the greatest capacity. These just happened to be the 5 habits Havard researchers selected to test. If I had my pick I would stick to my 5 pillars of health. <br /><br />Now I want to know what you guys think about living longer and anti aging. Is this something you're curious about as I am. Feel free to leave me your thoughts in the comments down below!<br /><br />News Release for Study: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/5-healthy-habits-may-increase-life-expectancy-by-decade-or-more/">https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/5-healthy-habits-may-increase-life-expectancy-by-decade-or-more/</a><br /><br />Harvard Study: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2018/04/25/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032047">http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2018/04/25/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032047</a><br /><br />Blue Zones : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bluezones.com/2016/11/power-9/">https://www.bluezones.com/2016/11/power-9/</a><br /><br />If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously.
