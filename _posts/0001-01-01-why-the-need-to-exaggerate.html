The third of three videos about homosexuality. In this one I also go into abortion. I talk about the exaggeration used by those who want to legislate against them.<br /><br />This is a pure one-taker, so occasionally, I misspeak or begin a sentence without ending it. If you either really prefer this approach for future philosophy videos or prefer me to edit them, *please* post your opinion, and I will see which is preferred.<br /><br />As usual, any and all feedback is very welcome.
