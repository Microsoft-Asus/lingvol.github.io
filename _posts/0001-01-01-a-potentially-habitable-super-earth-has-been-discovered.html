The universe is too big for us to be the only ones in it. It's just a matter of knowing where to look, and scientists from NASA's TESS program might have stumbled across the next clue in this galactic scavenger hunt. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite was launched in April of 2019 with the aim of locating planets in orbit around nearby stars. <br /><br />One of these stars is the comparatively small GEE-JAY 357. It's about 31 light-years from Earth.  It's one of the closest to Earth! Thanks to TESS, NASA astronomers discovered a planet orbiting this distant star. And in fact, it’s one of the few whose atmosphere can be studied by scientists, once they determine if it has one!<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />NASA Has Just Discovered a New Planet! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOGswBzxO54&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOGswBzxO54&amp;</a><br />The Solar System Is Not Like You Think It Is <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FvpAe3MacM&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FvpAe3MacM&amp;</a><br />The Real Size of the Universe (Even a Child Understands) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T08WOlFk4&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T08WOlFk4&amp;</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />What is this planet like? 0:27<br />A planet that is technically survivable for humans 2:15<br />Can we expect any alien visitors? 5:03<br />Why we can't see those planets directly 6:57<br /><br />#planets #space #brightside<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />- GEE-JAY 357 b is believed to be about twenty-two percent larger than Earth, and eleven times closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun. <br />- Scientists have discovered planets beyond our solar system before, but GEE-JAY 357-b is one of the closest to Earth. <br />- Hidden beyond the semi-molten glow of this “hot Earth,” as astronomers called it, were two more planets. One of them, GEE-JAY 357-d is just far enough from the star to potentially support life. <br />- Its orbiting inside its solar system's habitable zone, warm enough to support life, but not so warm that it ends up charbroiled. <br />- NASA scientists estimate that that planet has an average temperature of about minus sixty-four degrees. That’s cold, comparable to the interior of Antarctica.<br />- I wouldn’t expect any alien visitors for most of the same reasons humans will probably never be visiting GEE-JAY 357-d for themselves. <br />- If intelligent life developed, there’s no reason to believe it wouldn’t sooner or later turn its sensory organs to the stars. That's when the planet's gravity becomes an obstacle. I<br />- Scientists have estimated that reaching the moon of a planet ten times the size of Earth, would require almost five hundred thousand tons of fuel to get off the ground. <br />- It is worth noting that Astronomers haven't yet been able to see any of these planets directly. The TESS only discovered the massive and hot planet b because of its silhouette passing in front of the star.<br />- Since c and d never passed between Earth and GEE-JAY 357 during the month when TESS was able to capture images of the star, we've only been able to study them indirectly.<br />- The middle planet, called GEE-JAY 357-c just to make things confusing, didn’t even give us that. Because of its unusually tilted orbit, this planet never passes between Earth and its star at all.  <br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
