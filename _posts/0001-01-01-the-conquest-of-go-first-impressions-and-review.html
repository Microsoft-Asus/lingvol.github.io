{% raw %}The Conquest of Go is a NEW Go videogame on Steam! Packed to the brim with beautiful aesthetics, calming music, and a clean and smooth package wrapped around the top 3 Go AI's, I review the games' features and give you a chance to see the gameplay in action before you purchase! I am not sponsored by the game - however I would like to give an honest review so the Go community can share their thoughts in the comments! You can purchase the game in the link below!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264970/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264970/</a> <br /><br />Follow me on Twitch!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/goinsente">https://www.twitch.tv/goinsente</a> !!<br /><br />Follow on Twitter to get game updates and notifications of when I go live!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/in_sente">https://twitter.com/in_sente</a><br /><br />Support my work on Patreon!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/insente">https://www.patreon.com/insente</a>{% endraw %}
