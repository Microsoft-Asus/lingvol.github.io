{% raw %}**THIS IS A FAN MADE VIDEO**<br />**BEST VIEWED WITH HEAD PHONES &amp; IN HD**<br />Here is my tribute to my favorite Marvel character Captain America/Steve Rogers. I'm very pleased with how this turned out and I hope you are too. I had to use a few minor bootleg shots but I wanted to get this done before the hype died down. Loved EndGame and I hope you did too. Feel free to let me know what you think and if I should work on more tributes? (who should it be). If you enjoyed the video please subscribed so you know when I post new ones!<br /><br />-BEST VIEWED WITH HEAD PHONES!<br /><br />For the record I am doing this purely for fun, with NO intention of &quot;fooling&quot; anyone or covering up the fact that I used clips from other movies. <br /><br />Footage/Audio:<br />-Captain America: The First Avenger<br />-Captain America: The Winder Solider <br />-Captain America: Civil War<br />-The Avengers<br />-The Avengers: Age of Ultron<br />-The Avengers: Infinity War<br />-The Avengers: EndGame<br />-Thor<br /><br />Music: Captain America Theme Song, CÃ©zame Trailers - Remember Me, Somewhere Over the Rainbow (As Featured in the Godzilla King of the Monsters).<br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON ALL MY SOCIALS! <br /><br />TWITTER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/alistlk">http://www.twitter.com/alistlk</a><br />MAIN CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/alistproductions">http://www.youtube.com/alistproductions</a><br />2ND CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/alistproductions2">http://www.youtube.com/alistproductions2</a><br />TWITCH<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/alistlk">http://www.twitch.tv/alistlk</a><br />FACEBOOK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/youralist">http://www.facebook.com/youralist</a><br />INSTAGRAM<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/alistlk">http://www.instagram.com/alistlk</a> <br />WEBSITE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alistproductions.org">http://www.alistproductions.org</a><br /><br />This is an independent, non-profit, artistic expression created purely for fun and is in no way connection to, or endorsed by Marvel Studios.
