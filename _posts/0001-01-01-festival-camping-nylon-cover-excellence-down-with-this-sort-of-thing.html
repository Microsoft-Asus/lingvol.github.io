{% raw %}If you're at a camping metal festival and not camping... WHY NOT? <br /><br />Camping is one of the best parts of a metal festival! It's where you meet new friends, hang out with old ones and where you are going to generate a vast amount of stories.<br /><br />It's not just a place to sleep when you're not seeing bands. It's the lifeblood of the festival vibe. <br /><br />You gotta pick a good camping spot so your festival experience can be the best it can be. You can take you camp vibe as far as you like. You can have a chill quiet rest area or the MOST METAL THING EVER. Up to you really. Either way you're going to have fun and it will be TOTALLY METAL{% endraw %}
