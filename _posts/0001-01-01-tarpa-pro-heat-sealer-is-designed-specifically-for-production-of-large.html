TARPA PRO HF Welder heat sealer is designed specifically for production of large format tensile structures, membranes, tarpaulin, tents, oil booms, truck covers, swimming pool liners &amp; covers, airline hangars, large billboards, fast doors, side curtains, etc. Machine can be equipped with special impulse electrode for welding non HF weldable fabrics made of PE and PP, as well as FlexEL 'soft' multilayer welding electrode and curved HF electrodes for sealing round window profiles made of clear PVC and any other shapes requiring precision welding.<br /><br />TARPA PRO model is equipped with special high precision ball bearing linear motion gear, controlled by frequency inverter and glide-on railing to achieve a perfect continuous straight line seam. Optional vacuum work table with the length up to 100 meters and laser guides allow handling of large format materials and precision weld positioning for fast production setup.<br /><br />Full advanced programming functionality, including ATS™ auto-tuning, WCS™ weld control systems and expanded linear weld control (spot sealing, cycle left-right-left welds, parking and starting at any end, overlap welds) is achieved thanks to onboard PLC integrated with 10” touch screen HMI.<br /><br />TARPA PRO machines have HF power output 6/10/15/20kW and optionally 25kW for large production loads and reinforced heavy duty fabrics, effectively providing between 240-1000cm2 of welded surface with one weld cycle.<br /><br />Optional vacuum work table with the length up to 100 meters and laser guides allow handling of large format materials and precision weld positioning for fast production setup.<br /><br />The longest HF welding machine with 2 automatic welding heads and 70m table!<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Website: www.zemat.com/<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Zemattg/">https://www.facebook.com/Zemattg/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zemattechnologygroup">https://www.instagram.com/zemattechnologygroup</a>
