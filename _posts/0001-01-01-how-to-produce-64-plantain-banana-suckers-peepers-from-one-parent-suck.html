Cover them with sawdust to facilitate germination &amp; water depending on the soil moisture conditions.<br />8.sprouting of peepers(small suckers emerging from the soil) starts after 21 days.<br />9.Prick/remove the peepers &amp; transplant them at the post nursery where they continue to grow for four months before they are transplanted on the main field.<br /><br />Note After 21 days , each cut replicates 8 peepers. which means , 8*8=*64suckers*can be obtained from just one sucker through tissue culture.
