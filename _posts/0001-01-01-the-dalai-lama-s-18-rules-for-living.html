At the start of the new millennium the Dalai Lama issued eighteen rules for living.<br /><br /><br /><br />1. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk.<br /><br />2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.<br /><br />3. Follow the three Rs:<br /><br />         1. Respect for self<br /><br />         2. Respect for others<br /><br />         3. Responsibility for all your actions.<br /><br />4. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.<br /><br />5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.<br /><br />6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.<br /><br />7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.<br /><br />8. Spend some time alone every day.<br /><br />9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.<br /><br />10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.<br /><br />11. Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.<br /><br />12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life.<br /><br />13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation. Don't bring up the past.<br /><br />14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality.<br /><br />15. Be gentle with the earth.<br /><br />16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.<br /><br />17. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other.<br /><br />18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.
