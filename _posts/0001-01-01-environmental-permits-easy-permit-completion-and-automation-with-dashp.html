Automate your environmental permits for free here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiny.cc/a28gcz">http://tiny.cc/a28gcz</a><br /><br />Environmental permits are an essential part of maintaining environmental compliance and ensuring positive stakeholder relationships for the duration of your projects. <br /><br />Environmental permits exist to authorise work which could impact the environmental to move forward; to give work which could impact any parts of the environment the 'green light'. The problem with the state of current environmental permits and permit flows is that they take time, and are a constant collaboration headache between internal and external teams.<br /><br />Dashpivot streamlines environmental permits through digitisation and simple automated workflows. Once an environmental permit is created and signed off by the creating party - which might be a site engineer - that permit is automatically uploaded into the cloud and pushed to the next responsible party who needs to signoff on the permit. This workflow then continues until the permit is fully signed and closed out.<br /><br />This way, your environmental permit workflows are fully integrated and digital, meaning you don't have to jump back and forth between document types and systems and can instead manage permits from start to finish with Dashpivot - improving the speed at which your environmental permits move - and therefore the speed at which your projects move forward, safely.<br /><br />Learn more about Dashpivot environmental management system: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sitemate.com/environmental/environmental-project-management-software/">https://sitemate.com/environmental/environmental-project-management-software/</a><br /><br />See some environmental permit examples and best practices: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sitemate.com/resources/articles/environmental/environmental-permit-examples/">https://sitemate.com/resources/articles/environmental/environmental-permit-examples/</a><br /><br />Use a digital environmental clearing permit for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sitemate.com/templates/environmental/forms/environmental-clearing-permit-template/">https://sitemate.com/templates/environmental/forms/environmental-clearing-permit-template/</a><br /><br />Use a free environmental permit register here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sitemate.com/templates/environmental/registers/environmental-permit-register/">https://sitemate.com/templates/environmental/registers/environmental-permit-register/</a><br /><br />-----<br /><br />Transcript:<br /><br />Hi everyone, it's Sam from Sitemate. Permits are authorising documents containing approvals to proceed with types of works which may disrupt or disturb the environment to ensure that works carried out on your project are done so in an environmentally considerate way, so in this video we're going to look at how permit workflows can be set up in Dashpivot to allow you to track and manage permits with more speed and control, and this is quite different to traditional methods of recording and approving permits using things like PDFs and Word docs and so on, where you'd have to print it out, you'd have to sign it off, scan it back in email it to somebody, or give them a phone call to let them know that it's been uploaded, they would then have to print it out, review, sign, scan back in and email it back to you, all of those manual steps are just removed using Dashpivot because as items are signed off, they can be done so remotely using the Dashpivot app and you've always got a digital copy available to you wherever you are, so it's it's much easier than sort of the traditional back and forth that you might find managing permits in other ways, so we see that we've set up this environmental permit inside of Dashpivot, it's a clearing permit and we've set it up as a workflow meaning that if we were to add a new permit it's going to sit in this very first column and then as we sign it off it's going to move from common one to column 2 to column 3 and so forth until ultimately it is closed out. So I'm going to go ahead and add a new permit, you see that we've already configured this form so it's it's ready to go, we can start to fill out some of these fields, maybe we're doing some work next week from the 19th till the 23rd, and we can set an expiry date and this is really handy inside of Dashpivot because as soon as we select a date in here we're going to automatically display how many days are left before this permit expires, so whenever we open up this form it's going to tell us, well today it tells us that there's nine days before it expires tomorrow it's going to be 8 and the day after 7 and so on until it<br />will indicate that it's expired, so we can go through and fill out some of these fields, we've got some category fields for the area, we've got some dropdowns, we've got some checkboxes and we can add comments if required, we have a section for photos as well so if you need to add some photos to this particular permit this is really easy to do especially with the mobile app you can open up this form and as you're filling out this form you can take a photo using the app and attach that directly to this this form that's being filled out, and you'll have that sitting there and at the bottom we've got a section where you can upload PDF attachments, so if I was to upload an attachment here maybe it's a drawing of the site inside of the mobile app, then when we're on site and we're filling it out maybe we want to indicate (character limit)
