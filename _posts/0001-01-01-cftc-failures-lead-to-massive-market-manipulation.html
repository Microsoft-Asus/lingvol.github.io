We discuss the history of where CFTC got its powers to regulate the precious metals markets including gold and silver, along with all other commodities exchanges. <br /><br />We discuss how despite Congress passing appropriate laws, the CFTC's ability to set position limits on trades has failed repeatedly. <br /><br />The opposition to the CFTC boils down to huge commercial and financial interests, an activist district court, and a weak Commissioner who openly subverted CFTC authority on the markets. <br /><br />We show many studies, available on the CFTC's website, that show failure to enforce position limits has led to increased price volatility in food, agrigulture, and metals markets. <br /><br />And we show further how the swap dealers and financial firms use the spot market to control prices for up to two years with relative ease. <br /><br />We discuss why the most recent rules promulgated by the CFTC on October 15, 2020, are toothless and work in the favor of the commerical firms, especially the swap dealers. <br /><br />This video provides irrefutable evidence that market manipulation occurs, who is likely doing it, and why it has been allowed to occur. <br /><br />To secure your gold now, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://glintpay.com/goldsilverpros">https://glintpay.com/goldsilverpros</a><br /><br />For more visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goldsilverpros.com">https://goldsilverpros.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/goldsilver_pros">https://twitter.com/goldsilver_pros</a><br /><br />#gold #silver #oil #cftc #food
