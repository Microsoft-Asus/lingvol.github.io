{% raw %}In this Physics video lecture in Hindi for class 12 we explained interference of waves and Young's double slit experiment. Interference of light is a special phenomenon reflecting the wave nature of light. Due to interference of light two waves interfere with each other and where crest and crest or trough and trough meet amplitude of light becomes very large and we say, there happens constructive interference. Otherwise, when crest of a wave and trough of another one meet, they cancel the effect of each other and we say, there happens destructive interference.<br />The double slit experiment is a famous experiment conducted by Thomas Young where he used one source of light passing through two different slits and produced image on a screen behind. A very interesting pattern was found on the screen. There were several bright and dark patches which are known as fringes. This happens due to the wave behaviour of light and a special behaviour of waves, i.e., interference.<br /><br />★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★<br /><br />A special thanks to Derek Alexander Muller, creator of YouTube channel 'Veritasium'.
