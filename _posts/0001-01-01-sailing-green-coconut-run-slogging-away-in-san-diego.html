After an amazing sail through the Channel Islands we were forced once again into boat work purgatory. For five days we slogged away in San Diego Bay prepping Aldebaran for the voyage ahead. Thankfully we've cast off again...<br />We've coined our project the Green Coconut Run with the goal to connect wild and remote areas while surfing, diving and adventuring along the way. (It's a play on the classic sailing route through the South Pacific - the Coconut Milk Run.) In short we're looking to have a positive impact as we realize our dream of sailing and adventuring the south seas. <br /><br />For more information or to follow us please check out the GreenCoconutRun: <br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://greencoconutrun.com">http://greencoconutrun.com</a><br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/greencoconutrun">http://facebook.com/greencoconutrun</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/greencoconutrun">http://twitter.com/greencoconutrun</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/greencoconutrun/">http://instagram.com/greencoconutrun/</a><br /><br /><br />Music by Dirtwire - Sailing the Solar Flares <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/dirtwire/sailing-the-solar-flares">https://soundcloud.com/dirtwire/sailing-the-solar-flares</a>
