Overview<br />Too often, our community thinks of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) as just a finished product (or even just an indicator feed). But behind the scenes of that finished intelligence, there's an entire process that analysts should know to ensure their CTI is effective in helping drive better decision-making. Bringing together material from the FOR578: Cyber Threat Intelligence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sans.org/FOR578)">http://sans.org/FOR578)</a> course, this webcast covers the traditional Intelligence Cycle and describes key considerations for CTI analysts across each phase. Join FOR578 instructor Katie Nickels to learn the fundamentals every analyst needs to know about how to plan for, collect, process, analyze, and disseminate CTI to help your organization!<br /><br />Speaker Bio<br />Katie Nickels<br /><br />Katie is a SANS instructor for FOR578: Cyber Threat Intelligence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sans.org/FOR578)">http://sans.org/FOR578)</a> as well as the ATT&amp;CK Threat Intelligence Lead at The MITRE Corporation.
