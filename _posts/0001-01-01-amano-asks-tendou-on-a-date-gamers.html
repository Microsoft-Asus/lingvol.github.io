Gamers!<br />ゲーマーズ！<br /><br />⭐⭐⭐UPDATE⭐⭐⭐<br />Hey guys, since school is restarting for me in like a week, I decided to change my upload time. Yeah sorry about that. Anyways, I will be uploading 1~2 (maybe 3...depends on the anime) videos every 2 days starting next week. Hope you guys understand that and sorry again:(. It's sad for me too.<br />⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /><br />He finally accepts the reality where he dates Tendou. I really ship them both.It's funny how Tendou is surprised when Amano asked her on a date. I mean isn't that what couples do? Geez, I would love to see them kiss, but I don't think that would be possible since this anime looks like the type to mess around with the audience. Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed this video and don't forget to like &amp; subscribe for more future content like this:)!!<br /><br />Follow me here❤️😍❤️:<br /><br />📹🔴Subscribe🔴📹⚫: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNQFV4cqVYrGC8TkqknENvA?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNQFV4cqVYrGC8TkqknENvA?view_as=subscriber</a> <br />👥🔵Facebook🔵👥: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/animemediastudio/">https://www.facebook.com/animemediastudio/</a><br />📷⚫Instagram⚫📷: peiz_tian<br /><br />⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👇👇👇Some info about this anime👇👇👇⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /><br />This is a story that revolves around certain students and one hobby.
