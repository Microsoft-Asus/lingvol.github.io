If you choose one of the most useless degrees you will be throwing your money away.  Unfortunately, there are MANY degrees that are useless out there but if you just watch this video you will know which ones to avoid.<br /><br />Just wanted to clarify that the knowledge learned from these degrees might be invaluable, but the piece of paper you get definitely isn't if it doesn't lead to you getting a job...  And when you can get the knowledge for free in many other places then why pay $30k+ for it?<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKZ20yD2tNMBOkSDZo4FeQ?view_as=subscriber?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKZ20yD2tNMBOkSDZo4FeQ?view_as=subscriber?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />► My College Major Rankings + Investment Portfolio: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ShaneHummus">https://www.patreon.com/ShaneHummus</a><br /><br />LIMITED TIME: Get 2 FREE STOCKS ON WEBULL when you deposit $100 (Up To $1400 Value):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://act.webull.com/kol-us/share.html?hl=en&amp;inviteCode=Exkhp2KUZSrd">https://act.webull.com/kol-us/share.html?hl=en&amp;inviteCode=Exkhp2KUZSrd</a><br /><br />Before I start the list I just want to say that all of these have really bad stats when it comes to average salary, job openings, future growth etc etc so I’m not going to mention that because it would really be beating a dead horse and would get extremely repetitive<br /><br />Really short description this time
