Nowadays one can find absolutely anything online. There's even no need to go to a library, as almost every book you need is in digital format. Very often we catch ourselves googling every question that appears in our heads. Or if a friend doubts what the right answer is, we say &quot;ok, let's google it&quot;. But how cool is it to show your knowledge about various facts using... just your brain! You don't need to access any webpage - just search for the right answer in the best computer ever - your head!Â <br /><br />For example, next time you see a knob made of brass, you know why it is made of this material: actually brass prevents the spread of germs. And next time you get yourself a Chupa-Chups and notice a tiny hole on top of its stick, you know it's there to make it hard for the candy to come off the stick. Want more random cool facts?
