This short, 6 minute guided meditation will help to be a reset for any stress or anxiety you may have during the day. Think of it like a coffee break for your brain - relaxation techniques that will help to bring a mental rest in the morning or afternoon while you work or study.<br /><br />As I say at the end of this meditation session: Today, you will keep a powerful balance between your body and mind. You will possess the ability to think clearly in the moment, and remain focused and present - ready for your tasks and interactions. You will be guided by your breath and a still mind. <br /><br />I created a 12-page meditation guide that I want to give you for free!
