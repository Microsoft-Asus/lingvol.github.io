{% raw %}Modals of ability.  In this video you learn how to use the modals of ability: can, can't, could, couldn't and be able to as well as the verb manage.  Learn when you use the modals and why.  Learn the differences in meaning of the different modals.  With example sentences and a test at the end to see how much you have learned.<br /><br />Transcript <br /><br />Hi, Today we are going to learn about modals of ability. Remember to turn the subtitles on so you can follow along.  let's get started.    <br /> <br />The modals of ability are can, can't could, couldn't, and be able to.  I will also talk briefly about manage which also refers to ability but is not a modal verb.   <br />Let's start with:   <br />CAN  and can't  <br /> We use can and can't to talk about someone’s skill or general abilities. <br /> <br />She can swim like a fish. <br />Or  <br /> <br />They can’t sing very well, can they?  <br />  <br /> We use can to talk about the ability to do something at a given time in the present or future: <br />You can make a lot of money if you work hard.  This is referring to the future but we use can.   <br />or referring to the present  <br />We can’t see anything. <br /> <br />Generally, we use can and can't in spoken English rather than be able to as it is shorter and less formal.   <br /> <br />Now let's look at COULD  <br /> <br /> We use could to talk about generally about a skill or ability in the past.   <br />She could swim like a fish.  <br />They couldn’t sing very well. <br /> <br />We use could have + past participle to say that someone had the ability/opportunity to do something, but did not do it: <br /> <br />I could have danced all night [but didn't]. <br /> <br />CAN AND COULD  <br /> <br /> We use can and could with the senses:  see, hear, smell, feel and taste.   <br />From the top of the hill, we could see for miles.   <br />I can smell something burning.  <br /> <br />Moving on to BE ABLE TO  <br /> <br />Be able to is like can. But more formal.  <br />We use it to talk about abilities. We often use it in places where it is not possible to use can. For example, it isn’t possible to use can after another modal verb: <br /> <br />I'm free this evening, I might be able to go to the party with you.   <br /> <br /> <br /> Was/ were able to when speaking about something someone succeeded in doing on one particular occasion.   <br /> <br />Mum didn't have any money on her but fortunately, she was able to pay by credit card.   <br /> <br /><br /> <br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/oxford_now">https://twitter.com/oxford_now</a> <br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfordenglishnow">https://www.facebook.com/oxfordenglishnow</a> <br />WEBSITE:  www.oxfordenglishnow.com <br /> <br /> <br />Here are some other related English lessons: <br /> <br />   <br />Videos: <br /> <br />Modals of Possibility : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ce1ciK">https://goo.gl/ce1ciK</a> <br />Modals of Certainty :  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xvDvTG">https://goo.gl/xvDvTG</a> <br /> <br />PET Speaking Part 1  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/thWKCW">https://goo.gl/thWKCW</a> <br />PET Speaking Part 2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Xbg9ME">https://goo.gl/Xbg9ME</a> <br />PET Speaking Part 3 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/HLTmmZ">https://goo.gl/HLTmmZ</a> <br /> <br />Say and Tell – what is the difference    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rbD7bH">https://goo.gl/rbD7bH</a> <br />Agreeing and Disagreeing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/oWRDTu">https://goo.gl/oWRDTu</a> <br />As and Like <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/kxvEZb">https://goo.gl/kxvEZb</a> <br />Despite, in spite of, although, though and even though <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/pUuemL">https://goo.gl/pUuemL</a> <br />Kitchen Vocabulary <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/f7yDWs">https://goo.gl/f7yDWs</a> <br /> <br />Comparatives:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/j7Wi4X">https://goo.gl/j7Wi4X</a> <br />Superlatives: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/RWHxbJ">https://goo.gl/RWHxbJ</a> <br />Adjective Order: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/s1nhpY">https://goo.gl/s1nhpY</a> <br />Common English Expressions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Ugs5oo">https://goo.gl/Ugs5oo</a> <br /> <br />Present simple vs present continuous : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ZvfG6p">https://goo.gl/ZvfG6p</a> <br /> <br />Zero Conditional <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rBsUgs">https://goo.gl/rBsUgs</a> <br />First Conditional <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/dvtbEq">https://goo.gl/dvtbEq</a> <br />Second Conditional <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rIaGve">https://goo.gl/rIaGve</a> <br />Third Conditional <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ubL3oT">https://goo.gl/ubL3oT</a> <br /> <br />Playlists <br />Vocabulary <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nLcb6U">https://goo.gl/nLcb6U</a> <br />Conditionals <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/wxiCIo">https://goo.gl/wxiCIo</a> <br />FCE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/WCmD1u">https://goo.gl/WCmD1u</a> <br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Artist: Nicolai Heidlas<br />Title: Drive<br /><br />modals of ability{% endraw %}
