If there is one place on earth where it doesn’t matter if it rains, if snows, or if the sun shines because it’s beautiful never the less - it must be Lofoten Islands in Norway. A  rugged mountain chain is rising up from the Gulf Stream, forming a rare and unique world. It’s wild and beautiful, with azure blue water, white beaches, green mountainsides, beautiful fjords, old fishing towns and maybe some of the most spectacular roads in the world.<br /><br /><br />Here are my Highlights for a visit on Lofoten islands: <br />- Visit the town Å i Lofoten<br />- Sleep in traditional Rorbuer, old fishing huts that are often reused as appartments and rent out to tourists<br />- Dine at Holmen Restaurant<br />- Drive over the stunning Fredvang bridges<br />- Check out the artistic village Henningsvær and it's football field, that is situated on it's own island<br />- Visit Nusfjord, one of the best preserved historic fishing villages in all of Norway<br /><br /><br /><br />On our arrival with the ferry from Bodø in Moskenes on the island Moskenesøy of Lofoten we first did a trip to the most southern village of the island - that has the shortes name I ever came across: Å. After arriving in our accommodation Eliassen Rorbuer I invited my travel partner to Holmen Restaurant for a amazing dining experience. <br />The next day we finally took off to explore Lofoten: We drove over water at the beautiful Fredvang bridges, visited Nusfjord and it's restored historic village, looked at some art boutiques and the football field at Henningsvær and ended our day in Svolvær. Why I loved Lofoten? Check out the video for some of the most scenic shots of this whole journey!<br /><br /><br />// NEW EPISODE OUT EVERY THURSDAY 19:30 CET<br /><br /><br />//Join the journey from Switzerland to Nordkapp - to Europes barely inhabited places and it's last big secrets.
