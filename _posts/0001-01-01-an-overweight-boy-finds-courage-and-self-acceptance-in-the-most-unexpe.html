Being yourself is even harder.<br /><br />Overweight, shy and introverted, Ari wants nothing more than to fit in. He develops a crush on his fellow student, Jess, and attempts to lose weight and become more outgoing in his quest to belong.<br /><br />But his efforts only cause him more humiliation and pain, making him feel even lonelier and sadder. Finally, he makes a public declaration of his own self-acceptance -- and discovers his own value.<br /><br />This touching coming-of-age short touches on universal themes and common experiences that have been mined before, but director Alex Murawski offers a fresh, engaging take on the genre, capturing Ari's story with beautifully precise camerawork and well-honed performances. They bring to life a well-crafted script that underplays the emotions without ever undercutting them, and the result is a film that is still sensitive and avoids melodrama.<br /><br />&quot;Ari&quot; immerses the viewer in the main character's inner life, truly allowing audiences to inhabit his existence and open up a wellspring of compassion. Self-acceptance and the courage to be yourself are universal themes, but Ari's final actions in the film are surprisingly thought-provoking and heartwarming -- and will have you smiling to yourself at the end.<br /><br />ABOUT OMELETO<br />Omeleto is the home of award-winning short films.
