Ashanti Johnson is a Fitness Instructor and the Owner of a fitness brand 360.Mind.Body.Soul that combines physical fitness with mental fitness. It all started with her vision. Everyday for 1-year she would day dream about her business without doubt, fear or judgement. Little did she know she was visualizing and the more she allowed the unfolding, it intensified until it became a full blown reality.<br /><br />How often do we visualize and immediately talk ourselves out of looking deeper? What would happen if you allowed the vision to fully express itself? What would happen if we cultivated a visualization practice? Ashanti shares her story of what happens when you allow your vision to reveal itself fully, unabridged.<br /><br />Ashanti has helped thousands lose tens of thousands of pounds in classes and transformational weight-loss programs online and in-person. She has contributed advice to Fitness Magazine, NBC News and dozens of TV and radio shows.<br /><br />As a frequent speaker, Ashanti loves to share the latest research about the connection and disconnection between mind, body and soul.
