Did you remember to turn off the lights before leaving home? Did you cut your shower short this morning? While these issues are important in decreasing your carbon footprint, Diana Ivanova argues that how you spend money is significantly more impactful.<br /><br /><br /><br />Diana Ivanova is currently a PhD candidate in the Industrial Ecology Programme at NTNU. She works with an EU project, GLAMURS, which aims to promote a global transition towards sustainable lifestyles and a green economy. Dianaâ€™s research focuses on environmental consequences of household consumption and lifestyles. She uses statistical, econometrical and other techniques to analyze the impacts of products and services consumed by households. Diana comes from an academic background based in environmental economics and sustainability and has earned degrees both from Denmark and Sweden. <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
