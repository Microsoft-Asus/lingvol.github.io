From Dan Rather Reports (2009) &quot;SOLD&quot;. Rising unemployment, weak home prices and an increasing foreclosure crisis, are threatening families, cities and the entire U.S. economy. We speak to Harvard law professor, and bankruptcy specialist, Elizabeth Warren, who has studied the economy and foreclosures and their dramatic, long term effect on the middle class of the United States. Also, what happens to all those houses that are repossessed by the banks? They are often auctioned off to the highest bidder. A huge home auction in Fort Myers, Florida takes place over three days while just a few miles away families line up at a food kitchen. Learn how the great recession has created a surprising and burgeoning problem in the wealthiest nation on earth -- hunger. In this exerpt, Warren talks about &quot;Market Regulation&quot;.
