Nearly one month i rescued the rabbit from meat serve place. Now the seem bigger and i would like to build the rabbit hut in front of the last rabbit house and make the small pool with mini bridge for the rabbit playground yard. This way can make my rabbit feel more good and comfort with their new place new home and new life.<br />Thank you all beloved Subscriber always support my activity and my videos.
