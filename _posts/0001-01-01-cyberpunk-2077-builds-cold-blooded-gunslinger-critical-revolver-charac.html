If you’re a Night City citizen with Big Number Syndrome then you’ll want to check out this Build because you get some absolutely huge Crit numbers with it!<br /><br />Wiki: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cyberpunk2077.wiki.fextralife.com/Cyberpunk+2077+Wiki">https://cyberpunk2077.wiki.fextralife.com/Cyberpunk+2077+Wiki</a><br />More Builds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cyberpunk2077.wiki.fextralife.com/Builds">https://cyberpunk2077.wiki.fextralife.com/Builds</a><br />Cyberpunk Guide Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSIjQ9ekx24&amp;list=PLyT5NcCVqdX9GNaJ1Zv6OqGoMAcupmJcx">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSIjQ9ekx24&amp;list=PLyT5NcCVqdX9GNaJ1Zv6OqGoMAcupmJcx</a><br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 - Cold Blooded Gunslinger<br />0:49 - Cold Blooded Gunslinger Attribute<br />1:29 - Cold Blooded Gunslinger Perks<br />5:49 - Cold Blooded Gunslinger Equipment<br />7:05 - Final Tips<br /><br />The Cold Blooded Gunslinger Build uses Power Revolvers to great effect because they deal incredible per shot damage, and can often outright kill enemies with a single round if you hit the target in the head or weakpoint. This is because they have a 2x headshot damage multiplier, which is higher than just about every other weapon out there.<br /><br />When you combine the deadly fire power of the Revolver with Cold Blood you become an unstoppable force that just wades its way through enemies with ease. You’ll gain things like increased Armor, Crit Chance, Crit Damage, health regen and of course even more Headshot Damage! The more you kill the better you become, until you transform into Johnny Silverhand himself.<br /><br />Final Tips<br />I really like to use cover with this Build because you need to get Headshots to maximize your damage, and Revolvers don’t have a lot of rounds per clip so you can’t afford to waste shots. Cover allows you to aim precisely while minimizing the damage you take. In order to cover simply get near a ledge or doorway and aim and it should do this for you, sort of lean out or whatnot. If it doesn’t do this you will need to move closer, but you’ll get the hang of this fairly quickly.<br /><br />Always aim for the head if you can in order to go for one shot one kill. You don’t have to hold all your shots for the head, but try not to just pull the trigger as rapidly as you can. Also note that guns in this game seem to fire bullets just left of where you think they will land, so learn to aim just a hair to the left of the head.<br /><br />Damage drops off with Revolvers the further you are from the target so make sure you are close enough to deal good damage. Run and get into cover closer up if you need to. You’ll have excellent movement speed due to your high Reflexes so this shouldn’t be an issue.<br /><br />If you find a Revolver that you really like or one that just feels really good to you, you can upgrade it using Crafting. You’ll need materials to do this, obviously, but you can get these from scrapping weapons and armor in your inventory for parts.<br /><br />Lastly, remember that you can use Pistols with this Build too, though not designed specifically for them. There are some decent Pistols in the game as well, some deal shock damage which works well against machines, and it never hurts to have a backup weapon. Play around with them and find one that fits your playstyle!<br /><br />Follow us on social media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/">https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Fextralife">https://twitter.com/Fextralife</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/fextralife">https://www.twitch.tv/fextralife</a><br />Visit our wikis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/">https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/</a><br />Check out our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/">https://fextralife.com/</a><br />Visit our forums: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/forums/">https://fextralife.com/forums/</a><br /><br />#cyberpunk2077guide #cyberpunk2077 #cdprojektred{% endraw %}
