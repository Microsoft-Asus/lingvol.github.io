{% raw %}INCREDIBLE COOKING RECIPES NOBODY KNEW EXISTED<br /><br /><br /><br />Are you looking for new ways to make your dishes even more delicious? In this video, I show you how to come up with your own recipes that will help you create incredible lunches, breakfasts, and dinners. I also show you some useful tips and tricks you can try in the kitchen that will also save you some time. <br /><br />In the first video section, I show you how to peel any fruit you might have without any effort. You can remove the seeds from cherry using the opposite side of a funnel. <br /><br />I show you how to cut multiple onions at once by placing them on a skewer. <br /><br />I also show you how to peel a grape using a toothpick. <br /><br />You can also easily peel the skin off a tomato, by warming it up a bit on fire. <br /><br />To remove the skin of almonds, simply soak them in some boiling water. Both the liquid and the heat will lift the skin from the seed, and it will come off very easily. <br /><br />If you’re cooking fish, I show you how to peel the skin off of it using a carrot. You simply cut the carrot in an angle and then you try to peel the skin from the pointy side of the vegetable. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />1:38 – Amazing veggie hacks<br /><br />3:34 – Easy peeling tricks<br /><br />5:29 – DIY decorations for your fruit platter<br /><br />7:02 – How to peel hazelnuts<br /><br />9:19 – Adorable plate decoration ideas <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
