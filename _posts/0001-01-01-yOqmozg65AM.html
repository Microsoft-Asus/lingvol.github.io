This is my channel : MrrPhVannet mostly talking about Cambodia's social and political issues and it offers Cambodian people careful analytical thinking on Cambodian politicians.  For me, it doesn’t matter how hard I work for helping Cambodia people —It is necessary for making people take a clear and right decision by their own on the political and social realities. In fact, the general view in the society is making people have a lot of confused ideas.<br /><br />My goal is to make Cambodian people understand Cambodia’s social and political issues and shares new ideas for them in order to be away from being cheated by dishonest politicians just because Cambodia needs honest and respectful politicians, having clear intentions. Cambodian people do not need people who cheat them.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, there are two well-known politicians: Hun Sen, Cambodian Prime Minister and the ruling party leader, and Sam Rainsy, Cambodia’s most prominent opposition leader. <br /><br />There are also other well-known analysts and politicians talking about the social &amp; political: KEM SOKHA, KHEM VEASNA LDP, PICH SROS, WILLIAM GUANG, PHENG VANNAK, JAMES SOK, SAN BUNTHOEUN, KIM SOK, SO NARO, CHUN CHANBOTH, TAING SARADA, KUN CHANDY, MAK HOEUN, REACHBOTH AHSORKAY, YIM SINORN, SOK TOUCH, SARETH SOUK.<br /><br />In particular, it also provides you the English knowledge of English Khmer, Khmer English on Translation News/newspaper, Writing tips, Grammar study, Vocabulary. These are useful for Cambodian people to learn English easily on YouTube Channel Mrr​ ​PHVannet​<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for your coming, supporting and watching my governmental, political and social videos regarding the current situations of Cambodia. Finally, I do hope that everything goes smoothly and provides a number of useful videos for you. Thanks!!!
