{% raw %}found an old camcorder in my house and filmed my beautiful friends hanging out and making pancakes, enjoy!<br />Out now on Spotify, Apple Music etc.: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ampl.ink/emaM0">https://ampl.ink/emaM0</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/breakupfilms/">https://www.instagram.com/breakupfilms/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/breakupfilms/">https://www.facebook.com/breakupfilms/</a><br /><br />Mixed by Shimon Tal<br />Mastered by Aran Lavi<br />Music video by Noam Debel and Ron Herscovici<br />Artwork by Magnus JÃ¸rgensen<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />My wifi's acting up again<br />And those SIM cards never works<br />So I'll walk around the house, just to find the right spots<br />And time zones were invented<br />Just to make me feel alone<br />Cause we can't seem to find the right time to ever call<br />you know I couldn't even finish &quot;handmaid's tale&quot;<br />it's much less boring when you're there<br />and I even tried to pick up a book<br />but looks like I just can't prove you wrong<br /><br />So when you're getting no reception<br />I'll just go back to the day<br />that we drove down to the river<br />We got lost and walked for hours<br />And you asked<br />About all different kinds of flowers<br />But I couldn't tell their names<br />Won't you remind me once again?<br /><br />And maybe sometime in the winter<br />I hope that we can get together<br />Instead of talking about the things that we could do<br />we will grab a cup of coffee<br />and pass the whole night just rewatching<br />we'll laugh at how June always stays<br />And how it kinda felt like that while you were gone<br /><br />So when you're getting no reception<br />I'll just go back to the day<br />that we drove down to the river<br />We got lost and walked for hours<br />And you asked<br />About all different kinds of flowers<br />But I couldn't tell their names<br />Won't you remind me once again?{% endraw %}
