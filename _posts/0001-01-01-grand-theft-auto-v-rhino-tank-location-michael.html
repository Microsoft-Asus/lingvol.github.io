{% raw %}A video showing you how to buy and where to find the Rhino Tank in this game with Michael. First, very important, you must buy a hanger. It costs around half a million dollars but if you completed the game, you should have more than enough. Next, after you purchase the tank from the internet, you have to wait for the message that the tank has arrived. Then, simply go to your hanger and it will be there, or just switch it with the vehicle that you have already purchased.{% endraw %}
