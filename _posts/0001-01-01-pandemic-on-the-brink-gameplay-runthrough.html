Today Paulo Runs Through &quot;Rahdo's Goofs&quot;<br /><br />If you find Goofs I didnâ€™t notice Please leave Timestamps :)<br /><br />Thank You<br /><br />7:41 This is not correct... <br />First you resolve the 3 steps of the Epidemic card, as normal:<br />1- Advance Epidemic tracker<br />2- Infect a City (draw the bottom card of the deck and place 3 cubes there)<br />3- Shuffle the Infection discard pile<br /><br />And then you pause the game and determine the Virulent Strain. When that is done you resume the game and proceed to the Infection phase where you draw the number of cards from the top of the Infection deck and place cubes on the board.<br /><br />8:39 No it can't because that card isn't a Permanent Effect, it's checked when it's drawn and applies the effect then, in this case it wouldn't do anything.
