This calculus video tutorial explains how to use Riemann Sums to approximate the area under the curve using left endpoints, right endpoints, and the midpoint rule.  It also shows you how to calculate the area by evaluating the definite integral by using the process associated with sigma notation &amp; Limits at Infinity known as the definition of the definite integral.  This video contains plenty of examples and practice problems.<br /><br />My Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.video-tutor.net">https://www.video-tutor.net</a><br />Patreon:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br />Amazon Store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/theorganicchemistrytutor">https://www.amazon.com/shop/theorganicchemistrytutor</a><br /><br />Here is a list of topics:<br />1.
