Anarchism is a socio-political model taking various forms, but typically upholding certain specific principles. Broadly speaking, an anarchist society is a non-coercive anti-hierarchical society achieved without the traditional state apparatus in which members choose voluntarily to participate.<br /><br />This video provides a taxonomy of anarchism, explaining the primary features of different anarchist models. These descriptions are based on mainstream scholarly literature (see the bibliography link below), and can be considered reliably accurate in broad brush stroke terms.<br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:08 Definition of anarchism<br />1:09 Development of modern anarchism<br />1:37 Explanation of this video's treatment of anarchism<br />3:03 Three useful scholarly sources on anarchism<br />3:54 Explanation of the taxonomy used in this video<br />4:40 Collectivist anarchist systems<br />8:02 Individualist anarchist systems<br />12:03 Collectivist non-anarchist systems<br />15:55 Individualist non-anarchist systems<br />_____________<br />Bibliography<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/33855101">https://www.patreon.com/posts/33855101</a><br />_____________<br /><br />Media credit<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/mylittletripod">https://www.deviantart.com/mylittletripod</a>
