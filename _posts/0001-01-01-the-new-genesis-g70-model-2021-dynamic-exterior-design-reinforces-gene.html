{% raw %}2021 New Genesis G70<br />Let's meet the Genesis'The New G70', a sports sedan that reinforces the Genesis brand identity and adds the sensibility of a high-performance car.<br />Genesis The New G70 is the first facelift model to add a brand identity to the 2017 G70. Meet The New G70, which will further satisfy customers with the design that maximizes Genesis' unique dynamism, driving performance that adds the sensitivity of a high-performance car, and advanced safety and convenience specifications.<br />Genesis operates The New G70 with the same three powertrains as before: gasoline 2.0 turbo, diesel 2.2 and gasoline 3.3 turbo.<br /><br />'Sports+ (Sports Plus)' was newly applied to all models. The car optimizes the engine and transmission control by itself so that anyone can drive dynamically like a car racer without any separate shifting operation.<br /><br />In the Sport+ mode, the timing of shifting to the high gear is delayed as much as possible when accelerating and the speed of the transmission and engine is instantly matched when decelerating to accelerate the shifting timing of the low gear. This feature maximizes engine torque by using higher range RPMs if the driver wishes, allowing a dynamic driving feel.<br /><br />It also disables the ISG system (engine stop function while stopping) when stopping. In the case of gasoline models, an agile start is possible when restarting by maintaining an RPM range that can produce high output even while stopping.<br /><br />In particular, for the gasoline 3.3 turbo model, in addition to the Sport+ mode, additional specifications to add driving fun are operated. The'Variable Exhaust Muffler', which is added when selecting the'Sport' specification, applies an electronic variable valve to the exhaust muffler to adjust the exhaust gas discharge sound pressure according to the amount of depressed accelerator pedal, creating a sportier exhaust sound.<br /><br />If you select'AWD' as the driving method, more dynamic driving is possible through the'Dynamic AWD system'. When driving in a curved section, the accelerator pedal control raises the engine torque above the tire's limit performance, enabling the driving technology to escape the curve as if sliding.<br />THE NEW #GENESISG70 Model 2021<br />#Genesis' most dynamic sports sedan, the new #G70{% endraw %}
