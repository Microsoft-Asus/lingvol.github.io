{% raw %}Go Tell Aunt Nancy was written by David Carr Glover is in the scale of G@Level One Piano. The purpose of this piece is to teach and familiarize the student with two things: 1. That the first and fifth position of the scale tell the piano player which two major chords to expect to play in the song. 2. In most instances both hands are playing part of the chord so that when played together they form and complete the notes of the chord. <br />For example: Go Tell Aunt Nancy is written in the scale of G. The first note of G scale is G and the fifth note of G scale is D. The 7 refers to seventh so the two chords of G scale prove to be G &amp; D7. In addition we can expect that the right hand will play one part of the chord while the left hand plays the other part. Thus in measure one the B is played with the right hand and the G&amp;D with the left hand. This forms a G chord. In measure three A is played in the right hand C&amp;D in the left. This forms a D7 chord. Ayla plays Go Tell Aunt Nancy gracefully and smoothly. Nice going Ayla your dedicated practice is showing your growing talent. Smile! We look forward to the next video on your horizon. Go Ayla!!{% endraw %}
