They are a 6 tone sequence of special electromagnetic frequencies. They were originally used in Gregorian chants many hundreds of years ago, and recently, they were brought back to everybody’s attention for their healing powers.<br /><br />These frequencies induce movements of consciousness that will help stimulate new changes that are necessary for individuals who would like to achieve awakening. The frequencies are the following:<br /><br />★ 396 Hertz: DO. It is usually related to guilt and fear, and how they can suppress other emotions as well. It is associated with the color red.<br /><br />★ 417 Hertz: RE. It is usually related to past trauma and negativity and the willingness to change. This frequency can help you to recognize those past traumas that are no longer valuable in your life. It is associated with the color orange.<br /><br />★ 528 Hertz: MI. It is usually related to DNA, peace of mind, and clarity. This frequency will help you heal and remove any sickness you may have. It is associated with the color yellow.<br /><br />★ 639 Hertz: FA. It is usually related to Interpersonal relationships. This frequency will help you heal those difficult relationships you still have from the past while also reconnecting with those who are valuable in your present. It is associated with the color green.<br /><br />★ 741 Hertz: SOL. It is usually related to the emotional stability you are looking for. This frequency will help you solve any problems you may have in your life. It is associated with the color blue.<br /><br />★ 852 Hertz: LA. It is usually related to the views of oneself and the universe. It requires open space in order to allow intuition to come in. It is associated with the color indigo.<br /><br />★ 963 Hertz: SI. it is usually related to the feeling of oneness. It means awakening and interconnected to the universe. This frequency helps you to reconnect with yourself. It is associated with the color purple.<br /><br />It is understandable, however, to feel skeptical about the use of the Solfeggio frequencies and its application in real life. However, it is a well-known fact that music has healing properties.<br /><br />How to get the best from the Solfeggio Frequencies?<br /><br />You could try sitting or laying down, you could be on your couch or on the floor, you can do activities, work, relax, sleep. Do whatever resonates with you.<br /><br />Choose a Solfeggio frequency track: Perhaps you would like to start at the beginning? It doesn’t matter, as there isn’t a specific order for them to be played…in fact, you can choose to do one if you would like to focus on that specific frequency for the time being. Our favorite is 528 Hz which resonates with the color green and the heart chakra.<br /><br />You are ready to start: It is advisable to listen to the frequencies regularly, as you will get the best of them by doing so. <br /><br />Listen 14 - 28 days for noticeable results and a positive shift.<br /><br />Many experience a shift happening after the first couple of seconds of listening. Be consistent with it to truly raise your vibration to cleanse out old unconscious energy that holds one locked in a fear-based reality. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tribeofthehealers.com">https://tribeofthehealers.com</a><br /><br />- WOKE NATION
