Top 10 People You Won't Believe Actually Exist!<br /><br />All people are born unique. With perhaps the exception of twins, each of us are individuals quite<br />different from one another.

Yet five siblings in a family of 19 in Hatay, Turkey, walk not just primarily but only on all<br />fours, and lack the balance to do otherwise. Since the siblings were first discovered by scientists in 2005,<br />one popular explanation of their unusual quadrupedal gait was &amp;quot;reverse evolution&amp;quot;; meaning they could<br />be living proof that we can essentially devolve.<br />The five siblings are four sisters Safiye, Hacer, Senem, and Emine, and their brother Huseyn. All of them<br />can’t walk upright and have to move around on all fours doing a form of locomotion called “bear<br />crawling”. Although the five can stand upright, they can only do it for short periods of time.<br />The reverse evolution theory that is said to be the cause of the siblings’ unique condition has been put<br />into question lately, as scientists are currently looking in for other explanations for their conditions.<br />Recent studies have shown that their condition might be genetic in nature.<br /><br />Number 9. Rudy Santos<br />Rudy Santos was born with Craniopagus parasiticus or more popularly known as a parasitic twin– one of<br />the world’s rarest medical phenomena. As the name suggests, this condition happens when conjoined<br />twins are not fully separated in the womb. In the case of Rudy, his undeveloped twin came in the form<br />of additional appendages and body parts.<br />Apart from two extra arms and a deformed right leg, Rudy Santos also has additional shoulders, nipples<br />and undeveloped head attached at his sternum. This head is notable for having its own ears and a hairy<br />scalp. Parasitic twins are so rare of a condition that Rudy Santos is now officially the oldest man in<br />history to ever live with such deformity.<br />Due to his bizarre case, Rudy captivated many curious onlookers during the ’70s and late ’80s. He was<br />the main attraction at traveling fairs and was aptly named “Octoman” to attract more audiences. Rudy<br />was a national celebrity in his home country of the Philippines back then—earning at least $300 every<br />single night.<br />Now retired, doctors have offered to remove Rudy’s twin for him, but Rudy declined, saying that he has<br />grown too attached to his twin, both literally and figuratively.<br /><br />Number 8. Dede Koswara<br /><br />Dede Koswara is just a fisherman from Indonesia, but he is known all over the world. At some point<br />during his youth, he scraped his knee, and so began his lifelong struggles as the world’s most famous<br />tree man. After his accident, his body became covered with abnormal growths that were especially<br />prominent on his hands and feet. Because of the root-like growths on his extremities and the bark-like<br />patches on the rest of his skin, his condition caused him to become known as “Tree Man.” His body is<br />incapable of stopping the development of the growths, so they become larger with time.<br />Dede suffers from a rare disease known as Epidermodysplasia verruciformis also known as<br />Lewandowsky-Lutz dysplasia. This disease is a hereditary autosomal recessive skin disorder. As a result<br />of the disease, Dede has a heightened susceptibility to human papillomaviruses. Also known as HPV,<br />these conditions are very easy for the common person to contract. It has been said that up to 80<br />percent of people may be infected with a virus without showing symptoms.<br />For over 20 years, Dede’s case has confused and intrigued doctors and scientists, but no one has been<br />able to completely cure it yet. Although he underwent multiple operations to remove the warts, they<br />always grew back again.
