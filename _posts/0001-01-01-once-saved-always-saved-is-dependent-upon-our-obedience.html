OSAS is the belief that one can never lose salvation once you come to know Christ. The Word of God clearly tells us that we can turn from God, never truly be saved because it was never something we really meant within the heart etc. When we accept Christ we also accept His laws and are making a oath to strive to keep His commandments and obey His laws. Jesus was tempted and never gave in. WE DO have this ability because Christ dwells within us. We CHOOSE to sin just as we can CHOOSE to turn from the temptation. * INTRO MUSIC BY STRYPER.
