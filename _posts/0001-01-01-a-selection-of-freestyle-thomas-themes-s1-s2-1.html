This is something new!<br />If you've been following my Soundcloud page (I'll just put the link right hyah <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/hkporterbedt">https://soundcloud.com/hkporterbedt</a> ) you will find a few of these tracks I uploaded a few months ago. These usually evolve from boredom and then I try to make them sound melodic af :P. The last one in this was actually done today, and I suppose the whole purpose of this vid was because I haven't really done any S1-2 themes since I switched from MPC. In fact, you'll hear a few soundfonts I used to use for that program in these songs! Also, it's now been a year since I've been using FL :P<br /><br />No more paragraphs, so enjoy this video :)<br /><br />0:00 - The Viaduct Theme (Rock)<br />2:23 - The Other Runaway Theme<br />3:00 - The Watermill Theme<br /><br />Thomas and Friends belongs to HiT Entertainment<br />Original themes by Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell<br />Adapted by The Tuggster Intensifies
