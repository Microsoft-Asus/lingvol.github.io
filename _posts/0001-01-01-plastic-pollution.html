Plastics are durable, light and versatile. However, they take up to 400 years to decompose. This will affect peopleâ€™s lives for the next 16 generations. <br /><br />Our excessive use of plastics is impacting ocean health and biodiversity. By 2050, there could be more plastics in the ocean than fish by weight.
