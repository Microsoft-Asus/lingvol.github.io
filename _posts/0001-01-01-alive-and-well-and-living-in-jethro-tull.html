This is the song &quot;Alive And Well And Living In&quot; from Jethro Tull's 1970 album Benefit. Only appears on the UK version (US version replaced with Teacher). Appears on the CD version of this album.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Nobody sees her here, her eyes are slowly closing.<br /><br />If she should want some peace she sits there, without moving,<br /><br />And puts a pillow over the phone.<br /><br />And if she feels like dancing, no one will know it.<br /><br />Giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be.<br /><br /><br /><br />She can't remember now when she was all in pieces,<br /><br />She's quite content to sit there listening to what he says,<br /><br />How he didn't like to be alone.<br /><br />And if he feels like crying she's there to hear him,<br /><br />No reason to complain and nothing to fear <br /><br />They always will be.
