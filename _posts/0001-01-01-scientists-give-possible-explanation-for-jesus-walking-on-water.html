1. Professor of oceanography, Florida State University, Doron Nof in lab<br /><br />2. Two containers of liquid<br /><br />3. Nof testing ice on top of fluid, zoom in<br /><br />4. SOUNDBITE (English) Doron Nof, Professor of Oceanography:<br /><br />&quot;It could be about maybe 100 feet long, something like that, and that will be only next to the shore. It''s not going to be in the middle of the lake.&quot;<br /><br />5. Various of diagram showing how ice could have formed on the Sea of Galilee<br /><br />6. SOUNDBITE (English) Doron Nof, Professor of Oceanography:<br /><br />&quot;How does that tie in and if it is tied in at all to the Biblical story of someone walking on water, I don''t know, but all I''m pointing out is that this ice was there and someone could have walked on it.&quot;<br /><br />7. Various of Nof showing temperature graph<br /><br />8. SOUNDBITE (English) Doron Nof, Professor of Oceanography:<br /><br />&quot;I feel that my job as a natural scientist is to tell the society at large what I think could have happened in particular situations. What believers or non-believers do with this information is, kind of, up to them.&quot;<br /><br />9. Reverend Eckard at desk with Bible<br /><br />10. Pan from face to Bible<br /><br />11. SOUNDBITE (English) Reverend Rick Eckard, Grace Lutheran Church, Tallahassee:<br /><br />&quot;It doesn''t change my faith any. I mean, there''s a lot of different scientific theories, but if you''re a person of faith, I think you consider that and I don''t want to pay any disrespect to the science community, but I don''t think they have an explanation for everything and I think it''s interesting that they would go to this length to try to explain this miracle of walking on the water.&quot;<br /><br />12. Various of Eckard reading Bible<br /><br />13. SOUNDBITE (English) Mike McCarron, Florida Catholic Conference:<br /><br />&quot;We''re very respectful. We''re intrigued, but we''re also sceptical of those findings.&quot;<br /><br />14. Various of sign reading &quot;Florida Catholic Conference&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />STORYLINE:<br /><br /><br /><br />Jesus walked on water, according to the Bible, but a Florida State University professor says he may have actually walked on a hard-to-see patch of ice.<br /><br /><br /><br />Doron Nof, a professor of oceanography, said a rare combination of water and atmospheric conditions in the Sea of Galilee two thousand years ago may offer a scientific explanation for one of the miracles recounted in the Bible.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nof said a patch of ice floating in the Sea of Galilee, which is actually a freshwater lake, would have been difficult to distinguish from unfrozen water surrounding it.<br /><br /><br /><br />According to the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark and John, Jesus'' disciples were out on the Galilee at night when a storm happened.<br /><br /><br /><br />Jesus walked to the terrified men, who thought he was a ghost, according to the accounts.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nof''s research appears in the April issue of the Journal of Paleolimnology, a publication on the reconstruction of lake histories.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nof''s co-authors are biostatistics professor Ian McKeague of Columbia University and atmospheric science professor Nathan Paldor of Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br /><br /><br /><br />They came up with the theory after studying records of long-ago water temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea, based on core samples of shells and other animal remains taken from the bottom.<br /><br /><br /><br />The records indicated that two lengthy periods 2,500 to 1,500 years ago were chilly enough for ice patches to form during cold spells on the Sea of Galilee, said Nof, a native of Israel.<br /><br /><br /><br />The unfrozen water surrounding the ice would have come from salty springs along the lake''s western shore, he said. <br /><br /><br /><br />Salty water freezes at lower temperatures than fresh water.<br /><br /><br /><br />Some people, including Reverend Rick Eckard of the Grace Lutheran Church in Tallahassee, reacted with scepticism to Nof''s study.<br /><br /><br /><br />Eckard said the theory was a stretch and kind of funny, but he said it would not change his faith. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />keyword-unusual<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You can license this story through AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/674557a9ec96bacad35cdceefd5ed502">http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/674557a9ec96bacad35cdceefd5ed502</a> <br /><br />Find out more about AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork">http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork</a>
