{% raw %}In this video, I defend the utility and importance of the humanities - English, Philosophy, History - against the popularity of STEM subjects - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths. I argue that the humanities are indispensable to our endeavors as humans, whatever those endeavours might be.<br /><br />In a Defence of Poetry, written in 1821, Shelley argued that:<br /><br />'Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.'<br /><br />Support me on Patreon and pledge as little as $1 per video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/user?u=3517018">http://patreon.com/user?u=3517018</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fb.me/thethenandnow">http://fb.me/thethenandnow</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thethenandnow/">https://www.instagram.com/thethenandnow/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lewlewwaller">https://twitter.com/lewlewwaller</a><br /><br />Music:<br /><br />I Knew a Guy Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
