At the request of the CD's publishers, I'm adding the link to where you can buy this gorgeous CD, &quot;Avalon is Risen&quot;. It was independently published by a small company called &quot;Prometheus Music&quot;, which also publishes a lot of similar material, so if you liked this - give it a try!<br /><br />Avalon is Risen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.prometheus-music.com/avalon.html">http://www.prometheus-music.com/avalon.html</a><br /><br />Prometheus Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.prometheus-music.com">http://www.prometheus-music.com</a><br /><br />Leslie Fish's ballad about what's worth fighting for is a classic, and one of my favorite songs ever written.<br /><br />I do not own it. Ms. Fish does, and she's a wonderful lady.
