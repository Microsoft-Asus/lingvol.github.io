General Melchett shares some of his wisdom en gives an insight in the life of a British general during the first world war.<br />Behold as grand tactics unfold beneath your very own eyes and grasp you with this A-historic comedy.<br />&quot;He fails to understand or comprehend the basic concepts of modern trench warfare and is totally unable to come up with a new strategy that would suit it. Instead he continuously sends men to a senseless death with seemingly no tactics at all.&quot;
