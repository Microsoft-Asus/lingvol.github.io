Madlib re-working Donald Byrd's &quot;Stepping Into Tomorrow&quot;.<br /><br />Of COURSE the original is much preferred, but this sounds nice too.<br /><br /><br /><br />My favorite re-working from &quot;Shades of Blue&quot;... <br /><br /><br /><br />*Copyright Disclaimer*<br /><br /> Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
