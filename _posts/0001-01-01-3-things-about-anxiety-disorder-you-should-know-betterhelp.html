{% raw %}If you or someone you know is dealing with a challenging situation and could benefit from additional support, consider talking to one of the 2,000 licensed online counselors at BetterHelp.<br /><br />Anxiety manifests in people as the fear of something dangerous happening. You may have heard the phrase “fight, flight or freeze.” This term refers to what individuals do when they feel extremely anxious. “Fight” describes a person is who is actively defending themselves against a perceived threat, flight means that the individual feels the need to run away from the dangerous situation and freeze manifests as the person feeling paralyzed. <br /><br />When a person is anxious, they experience physical symptoms in addition to emotional ones. Often people who have chronic anxiety experience numbness and tingling, racing heart, sweating and shortness of breath. When you’re anxious your brain is telling you that you’re not safe and your body reacts to the perceived threat. It’s an evolutionary aspect of being a human being. In the past, people had to defend themselves against enemies whether they were other humans or dangerous predatory animals. In modern society, it’s unlikely you will come into contact with a grizzly bear in your neighborhood, but you can still experience panic in other current day settings.<br /><br />Whether there is a legitimate, tangible threat or a perceived danger, anxiety is extremely real, and your feelings are valid. For example, if you are physically assaulted, you feel frightened and panicked. Here you’re experiencing a dangerous threat that you can identify. Often anxiety isn’t linked to a tangible threat, but instead an abstract fear of what may occur in the future. When you feel anxious, you are worried about what could happen as opposed to what is happening right here and now. That’s why therapist often teaches clients mindfulness to bring them back to the present when they are anxious.<br /><br />If you’re having chronic anxiety or panic attacks you can get help for these problems. A mental health professional is trained to identify and treat anxiety or panic. Whether you find a therapist in your area or work with an online counselor, both professionals know how to help you develop coping skills to manage anxiety and start to live a healthier life.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: The information in this video is not intended or implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
