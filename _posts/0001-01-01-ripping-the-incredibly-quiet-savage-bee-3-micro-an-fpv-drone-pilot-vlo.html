I needed to discharge some whoop batteries the other day, so I pulled out my Savage Bee - a toothpick like micro FPV drone that is an ultra lightweight 3&quot; rig. This thing is SO QUIET! Whenever I show someone this micro drone that's the first thing they comment on.<br /><br />In this vlog, I'll try some power loops, matty flips, rubick's cube, flips and rolls. <br /><br />I love ripping this little drone - and I'll show you here that it can stand up to some crashes, too.<br /><br />#savagebee #roofpv #microdrone<br /><br />Note: I am a sponsored NewBeeDrone pilot, but I paid full retail price for the Savage Bee.
