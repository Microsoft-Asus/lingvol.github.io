This video contains our original audiobook reading of Flannery O'Connor's short story &quot;A Good Man Is Hard To Find.&quot;  Since the story is set in Georgia in the early 20th century, O'Connor's characters use the n-word sporadically. I have omitted those uses in this reading.<br /><br />This is the Actual Southern Accent version, not whatever is typically available with audiobooks.
