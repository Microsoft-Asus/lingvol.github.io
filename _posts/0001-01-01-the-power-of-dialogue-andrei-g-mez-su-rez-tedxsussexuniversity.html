This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Andrei Gómez Suárez explores the importance of dialogue, resorting to his experience in context of the peace talks in Colombia with the FARC. He describes the process of how the concept of dialogue brought about change in a country that suffered under violent conflicts for 50 years. <br /><br />Andrei Gómez Suárez is a researcher for the National Centre for Historical Memory of the Department of Social Prosperity of the Colombian Government and associate researcher in International Relations at Sussex University, with a current focus on the Santos-FARC peace talks. <br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
