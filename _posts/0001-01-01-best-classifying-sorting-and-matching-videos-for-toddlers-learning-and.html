Here’s a collection of educational videos by Kids Academy. The short fascinating videos will make classifying for kids easy and fun. <br /><br />Kids are sure to enjoy the activities about the undersea world where they need to match the little fish to the color so that the shark doesn’t eat them, help the wizard to put the things back after a terrible storm came through and find a nest to live for lovely birds. Our videos not only teach preschoolers sorting and matching, but also set a good example how to keep things in order and introduce to household chores: collecting toys after building a sand castle, sorting bathroom staff out, finding a matching T-shirt after mum has done the laundry.
