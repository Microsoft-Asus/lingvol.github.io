close but<br />We all know what this is gonna be<br />You came and failed the test<br />You met the best<br />Expected chess but got monopoly<br />I came and bought you out<br />I knocked you out<br />I cropped you out with no apologies<br />I am the hope, the heart, the fate, the spark<br />The one who will fulfill the prophecy<br />I've just been counting<br />Never lounging<br />Climbing up mountains<br />Bouncing back<br />Step in the ring or else just step back<br />Dale Earnhardt when I get on the track<br />I like it louder than most<br />Watching all these sheep just bow down to the goat<br />If I can't decide Ima probably get both<br />We don't celebrate but right now Ima toast<br />Resurrect the ghost<br /><br />Outside Outside<br />Looking at the stars starring with my mouth wide<br />I ain't letting nobody stop me this time<br />With every single level that I reach and I climb<br />They ask &quot;are you from...&quot;<br />Outside Outside<br />Everything around me I create with my mind<br />Working too hard I don't want no downtime<br />Put my team on they gon' shine when I shine<br />We can take this<br />Outside Outside<br />Looking at the stars starring with my mouth wide<br />I ain't letting nobody stop me this time<br />With every single level that I reach and I climb<br />They ask are you from<br />Outside Outside<br />Everything around me I create with my mind<br />Working too hard I don't want no downtime<br />Put my team on they gon' shine when I shine<br />We can take this<br /><br />Buckle up<br />Boy if you bout' it then double up<br />Remember your team when you hustle up<br />Don't make a move till' you huddle up<br />I'm coming up<br />F*ck is up?<br />Looking for trouble then knuckle up<br />I see through all of your cover ups<br />You think that you gonna' set me up<br />Good luck<br />Break it down<br />Who at the top imma' bring em' down<br />I will not stop till' you laying down<br />Till' I'm at the top and i'm gazing down<br />Sh*t ain't been the same since we came around<br />Since we became kings and became renowned<br />Since all of the truth started raining down<br />If you want that belt better buckle down<br /><br />Outside Outside<br />Looking at the stars starring with my mouth wide<br />I ain't letting nobody stop me this time<br />With every single level that I reach and I climb<br />They ask &quot;are you from...&quot;<br />Outside Outside<br />Everything around me I create with my mind<br />Working too hard I don't want no downtime<br />Put my team on they gon' shine when I shine<br /><br />You are just not on my level<br />I keep my foot on the peddel<br />I set the tone I don't settle<br />I can put fear in the devil<br />You are just not on my level<br />I keep my foot on the pedal<br />I set the tone I don't settle<br /><br />We can take this<br />Outside Outside<br />Looking at the stars starring with my mouth wide<br />I ain't letting nobody stop me this time<br />With every single level that I reach and I climb<br />They ask &quot;are you from..&quot;<br />Outside Outside<br />Everything around me I create with my mind<br />Working too hard I don't want no downtime<br />Put my team on they gon' shine when I shine<br />We can take this<br /><br />You are just not on my level<br />You are just not on my level<br />You are just not on my level<br />You are just not on my level{% endraw %}
