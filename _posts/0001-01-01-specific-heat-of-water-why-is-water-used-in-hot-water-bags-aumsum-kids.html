I told you.<br />At least now will you use this hot water bag?<br />You are feeling better, right?<br />Do you know how a hot water bag gave you warmth for such a long time?<br />This is due to a concept called specific heat.<br />Specific heat of a substance is the amount of heat energy absorbed or lost by that substance to change its temperature.<br />Now, the hot water bag consists of hot water.<br />As compared to other liquids like milk and acetone, the specific heat of water is much higher.<br />This means that as compared to others, water needs to absorb a large amount of heat to become hotter. <br />Now, did you know that water will take a long time to cool down as compared to milk and acetone?<br />Thus, water will take a longer time to become cool.<br />Hence, it proves to be very useful in hot water bags because the warmth can be utilized for a longer time.
