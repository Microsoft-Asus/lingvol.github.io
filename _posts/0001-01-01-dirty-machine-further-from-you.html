Los Angeles alternative metal act, Dirty Machine, have released their latest single “Further From You”, produced by Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Breaking Benjamin, Static-X, Pantera, White Zombie) and mastered by Gentry Studer (Incubus, Deftones, At The Drive-In, 36 Crazyfists, American Head Charge). <br /><br />Dirty Machine recently inked a worldwide deal with Zombie Shark Records, the new record label from Noah “Shark” Robertson (Motograter, The Browning), and released their debut album entitled, ‘Discord’. The album was produced by Ben Jovi and Dirty Machine at Left Coast Label Studios. The album was mixed by Arnold &quot;Hedge&quot; Quezada and Darren Davis at Blunoize Studios, and was mastered by Josh Wickman from Dreadcore Productions (KING 810, Within The Ruins).<br /> <br />Dirty Machine have been heralding the nu metal flag since 2012 and pull major influences from nu metal-era bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Nonpoint, Mudvayne and Sevendust. The band has been turning quite a few heads as they recently embarked on a U.S. tour with Insane Clown Posse, caught the attention of Fred Durst, and filmed a music video inside an IHOP Restaurant. The group was also recently named by Alternative Press as one of the ten “up-and-coming heavy bands you need to check out&quot;. <br /> <br />Dirty Machine also recently released the following music videos: <br /><br />&quot;DISCORD&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ca_Y9SDIsWc">https://youtu.be/ca_Y9SDIsWc</a><br />&quot;SELF MADE HERO&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OfCc7dmrnz0">https://youtu.be/OfCc7dmrnz0</a><br />&quot;BUILT&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/aCO5vLVXq9s">https://youtu.be/aCO5vLVXq9s</a><br />&quot;SOCIAL RECOIL&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x3E_Rx_TKXM">https://youtu.be/x3E_Rx_TKXM</a><br /> <br />DIRTY MACHINE is:<br />David Leach (Dirty Davo) - Vocals<br />Arnold Quezada (Hedge) - Guitar <br />Darren Davis - Guitar/Vocals<br />Ben Jovi - Bass/Backing Vocals<br />Mike Weekley (Nightmare) - Drums<br />DJ Ecusa - Turntables &amp; Samples<br /><br />Links:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://dirtymachineband.com">http://dirtymachineband.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dirtymachine13/">https://www.facebook.com/dirtymachine13/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.zombiesharkrecords.com">http://www.zombiesharkrecords.com</a><br /><br />Press:<br />zombiesharkrecords@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><br />▶NEW ▶ The official Spaceuntravel playlist on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/acLb4Z">http://goo.gl/acLb4Z</a><br /><br />▶Join Spaceuntravel on Facebook : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Spaceuntravel?ref=hl">https://www.facebook.com/Spaceuntravel?ref=hl</a>
