That is where this new study comes to the rescue.<br />In this study - the cells of participants aged in reverse by the equivalent of a staggering 25 years with something much less invasive than blood transfusions<br />Most generally accepted ways to slow down aging today only slows your body down by a tiny bit - so 25 years backwards is major<br />The method that they used to achieve these results isn’t limited to the ultra wealthy<br /><br />To understand how to cure aging, we first have to understand what causes aging.<br />Aging is one of those great mysteries in life that’s up there with how consciousness works - so there’s still much debate on what really causes aging<br />The ends of our chromosomes have what’s called telomeres<br />You can think of telomeres like the plastic ends on your shoelaces that keep them from fraying<br />And when your telomeres have been exhausted - that cell can’t divide anymore and it turns into a senescent cell<br />These zombie cells contribute to things like diabetes, heart disease, and more<br />This is what researchers at the Tel Aviv University were about to change - to not just slow down the shortening of your telomeres, but to actually regenerate telomeres to make them longer<br /><br />Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers are basically where you lay inside a tube that’s pressurized with 100% oxygen<br /><br />They took 35 adults that were 64 or older and put them through 60 oxygen chamber sessions over the course of 3 months, at 5 sessions per week<br /><br />Thanks to the oxygen chamber therapy, all the telomeres of these important cells grew by a significant amount, with some telomeres repairing nearly 40% of its length!<br />The same is true when researchers measured how many of those zombie senescent cells remained<br /><br />For the first time, we’ve discovered that you can age your blood cells - backwards by 25 years<br /><br />Should you do this yourself? It depends on how much money you have to throw around<br />But not all hope is lost if you’re not rolling in cash<br />As this technology gets more attention, as more people are interested in doing this kind of therapy, as the economies of scale go up - prices will go down<br /><br />The dream of immortality is a far off one<br />But this is a step in the right direction<br />-----------------------<br /><br />All materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
