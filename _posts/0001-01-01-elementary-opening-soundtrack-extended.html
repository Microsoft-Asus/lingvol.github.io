Since I couldn't find any extended version of this song on youtube, I decided to do it myself. This is an extended version of the already extended song that I found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://seancallery.com/">http://seancallery.com/</a><br /><br />NOTE: I do not own the credits for this music. Here's, again, the author's website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://seancallery.com/">http://seancallery.com/</a>
