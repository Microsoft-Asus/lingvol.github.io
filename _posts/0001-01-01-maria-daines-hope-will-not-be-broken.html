'Hope Will Not Be Broken'<br /><br />How much can a heart hurt<br />Can we live when it breaks<br />Is trust our anchor<br />In the loss of our mistakes<br />How far and how wide<br />Are the pieces buried deep<br />Praying with the angels<br />In the love we sing to sleep<br /><br />Listen to the ocean<br />The crying of the waves<br />Hope will not be broken<br />She sends her love to save<br /><br />How gently we climb<br />On the walls to see the view<br />Look down into forever<br />The wishing well of truth<br />And nobody hears <br />The siren on the rocks<br />Forget all time and space<br />And smash the clocks<br /><br />Listen to the ocean<br />The crying of the waves<br />Hope will not be broken<br />She sends her love to save<br /><br />Feel the pain, the affray<br />Set it down, let it go<br />Another heart in the wreckage<br />The place that lovers know<br />The doors that we should close<br />Only let the demons in<br />And on and on the story goes<br />We never win<br /><br />How much can a heart hurt<br />Can we live when it breaks<br />Is trust our anchor<br />In the loss of our mistakes<br />How far and how wide<br />Are the pieces buried deep<br />Praying with the angels<br />In the love we sing to sleep<br /><br />Listen to the ocean<br />The crying of the waves<br />Hope will not be broken<br />She sends her love to save<br />Sends her love to save<br />To save...<br /><br />Â© Maria Daines/Paul Killington<br />4th October 2020<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://maria-daines.com/">https://maria-daines.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/maria-daines">https://teespring.com/maria-daines</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MariaDaines">https://twitter.com/MariaDaines</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MariaDainesBand/">https://www.facebook.com/MariaDainesBand/</a><br /><br />Our thanks to Kalhh for the beautiful picture.
