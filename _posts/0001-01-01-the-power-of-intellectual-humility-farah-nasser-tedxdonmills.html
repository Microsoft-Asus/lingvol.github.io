What happens in a world where everyone thinks they know better? In a world where we lack intellectual humility? I want challenge you to channel your internal journalist when you come face to face with someone who you may see as the other and who likely sees you as the other. Thinking like a journalist might help us unravel our own bias. Farah is an award-winning journalist and anchor on Global News. She has been covering relevant and significant stories for nearly two decades and now brings a personal yet widely relatable story to the TEDxDonMills stage. Farah will challenge us to think differently through the lens of pluralism and the power of gaining knowledge about others. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
