We are all guilty of adding some sugar here and there to make things taste better, but what might seem like innocent pleasure can actually cause a lot of serious health issues when we put too much sugar in our body. Luckily, our system gives us crystal-clear signs when we’ve crossed that line and should stop doing that immediately to protect ourselves from health problems. <br />Large amounts of sugar in your diet cause your cells to go through complicated biochemical processes that result in muscle aches and pains, joint stiffness and swelling.<br />Food high in sugar won’t make you feel full because it doesn’t contain any useful nutrients, which is why you often feel hungry even if you just ate a big delicious sugary muffin like half an hour ago. When you eat sweet stuff, the pancreas releases insulin to help bring glucose to the cells, giving you a rush of energy. Once the cycle ends, though, your energy levels drop because your body wants more sugar. And this can start a never-ending cycle of overeating sugar in order to stay energized.<br />If not brushed away properly, food debris causes the appearance of plaque on your teeth, which erodes the tooth’s hard enamel surface resulting in tiny holes. Always make sure to brush AND floss your teeth properly, use an antibacterial mouthwash, and visit your dentist regularly.<br />Bloating is directly connected to what you eat and how your body can digest it. If sugar isn’t absorbed into the small intestine (and not all of it will if there’s too much of it), it’ll enter the large intestine where it usually acts like gas-producing bacteria.<br /><br />Music: <br />Diamond Ortiz - Mirror Mirror<br />Otis McDonald - Side Steppin'<br />Quincas Moreira - Bluesed and Abused<br />Rondo Brothers - Valerie Plain<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />#9.
