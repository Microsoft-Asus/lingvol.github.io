Let’s Build Character, learn more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/preschool/explore">https://education.lego.com/en-us/preschool/explore</a><br /><br />In preschool, children are laying the foundations for their future character. By facilitating learning through play, preschool teachers help children build essential life skills, developing creative and inquisitive lifelong learners. By uniquely combining the fun and creativity of LEGO® and LEGO DUPLO® bricks with teaching resources designed to support specific learning outcomes, we support preschool teachers in delivering engaging and effective learning experiences that develop essential skills for every child.
