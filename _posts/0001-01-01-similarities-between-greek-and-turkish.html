How similar are Turkish and Greek and to what extent can Turkish and Greek speakers understand one another? While being part of two different language families, because of the historical interactions they have had, the two languages and nations have a lot in common. There are many words in both languages which are derived from the other. In this video, Alexandra (Greek speaker) and Şimal (Turkish speaker) demonstrate some of the commonalities between the two languages through a list of words and sentences.<br /><br />Check out Alexandra’s channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC22FKc2k2aH8VXTLy-LSAvA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC22FKc2k2aH8VXTLy-LSAvA</a><br /><br />Once again, we just want to thank those who took part in the latest Instagram poll and voted for this video!

The Greek alphabet, originating from the Phoenician script, was the basis of numerous other scripts, such as Latin, Cyrillic, Coptic, Gothic, and Armenian. The Greek language has virtually impacted other languages in every corner of the world, being an important component of Western civilization, the Christian religion, and the language of some of the fundamental texts of science, astronomy, and mathematics. The Greek language today holds official status in Greece and Cyprus, and is recognized as a minority language in Albania, Armenia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Ukraine.<br /><br />The Turkish language (Türkçe), which is also referred to as Istanbul Turkish, is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with most of its native speakers living in Western Asia, and significant group of speakers in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia. Ottoman Turkish, which was a variation of the Turkish spoken today, influenced many parts of Europe during the time that the Ottoman Empire expanded. When the modern Turkish republic was established, one of Atatürk's Reforms consisted of changing the Ottoman Turkish alphabet with a Latin alphabet. Today, Turkish is recognized as a minority language in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Iraq, Macedonia, and Romania.
