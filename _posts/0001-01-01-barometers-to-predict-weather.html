Changes in Your Barometers Readings Will Predict the Weather! Go To! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ClockParts.com">https://ClockParts.com</a> to view your Barometer Options<br /><br />Reach Us At: 888-827-2387 <br /><br />The barometer is the most important weather instrument because it helps you to predict weather changes. <br /><br />Barometers measure air pressure in “inches of Mercury” or in “millibars”.  Air pressure changes normally indicate changes in the weather. <br /><br />High pressure areas and low pressure areas, called “fronts” basically determine our weather. Changes in air pressure are what you need to pay attention to. <br /><br />Your barometer actually has two different hands, or indicators. The black indicator hand always points to the current air pressure. The gold “constant” indicator can be turned to match the current barometric pressure. This makes changes easy to see. <br /><br />A change to high pressure means good weather is ahead.  A change to low pressure means bad weather is on the way. You can’t change it, but at least you can be prepared.<br /><br />Our barometers are factory calibrated. It’s highly unlikely that you will be using your barometer at the same altitude as the factory. <br /><br />Your new barometer has to be calibrated  to your location after you receive it. Any local television or radio station will have this information.  Calibrate your barometer during the local evening news.<br /><br />Take a Look At Our Barometers by Going To:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.clockparts.com/new-2-3-4-barometers/">https://www.clockparts.com/new-2-3-4-barometers/</a><br /><br />If you look on the back of our barometers, you will see a small brass slotted screw. Gently turn in either direction no more than 1 revolution to adjust the barometric pressure reading. <br /><br />If the weatherman say it’s 30.2 inches of mercury, then change the black indicator to about 30, then move to the little 2 to the right. If it’s 29.5 inches of Mercury, then go to the left and look for the “29” then the little “5”. <br /><br />You have now calibrated your barometer. Turn the little brass knob and hand in the middle of the barometer face to match the black indicator hand. Now you will be able to see and “predict” short term changes in the weather.<br /><br />We have a nice selection of barometers for your next DIY Project.
