PLEASE, WATCH IN HQ AND WEAR HEADPHONES (lots of sound fx)!<br />This is a fanfic trailer I made for a fanfiction called A Touch Of Sin by Pettey. You can read it here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/10236242?view_full_work=true">https://archiveofourown.org/works/10236242?view_full_work=true</a><br /><br />Author’s summary: After his transfer to a quiet seaside town, Jeongguk was prepared to face a year of uneventful CID work, but found himself dealing with a series of strange murders instead.<br /><br />I have so much to say about this author, she’s absolutely brilliant. And I’m not just talking about this one story, that I love to bits, but every single one I’ve read by her is incredibly well-written with complex characters and exciting dynamics and themes and perfect pace and structure, and very original settings, and the details always blow my mind... There is so much dedication and talent it’s unbelievable. I read this one comment from the author herself, which I think summarizes this fanfic perfectly, but also happens to reflects her writing style and her preferences (read over themes etc.): “Introspective and more screenplay-oriented than a straightforward linear procedural. It's about human condition, so it unfolds accordingly with that theme, through JJK as an unreliable narrator. It's ptsd and certain stigma, isolation, corruption, cultural repression, misplacement, dissociation, and painful process of trust; toxicity of confined communities; generational tensions and war guilt; human cruelty and the issue of how we perceive time and project our insecurities on others; coming to terms w/ self beyond the definitions that others are so inclined to put on you and use you as they see fit.” Yes, this is the type of quality reading you’re about to get if you give it a chance. These stories are the reason why I love being in this fandom. Thank you so so so much, Pettey, you’re one hell of a writer and a little bit crazy, but impossibly cool and I love ya and your thoughts and everything I get from your stories ;). I hope you like the trailer, I tried my best, promise.<br /><br />As for the video, I gotta say, this was quite an experiment. It’s far from perfect, or the way I’d truly love to depict the story, since as usual I had to make some changes in certain scenes due to lack of usable BTS footage. But overall, I hope the message is there. The things I presented in the trailer were the ones that stood out to me throughout reading and which I found essential to character and relationship development. It’s edited purposely vague, so if you wanna understand exactly what’s going on in the trailer, pick up the story, will ya ;). And for those of you who like to read about the more technical details of my editing (since I always get messages about how to make storytelling videos) – I chose this instrumental composition (and I got chills the first time I heard it, let me tell you), because you can look at the fic through multiple lenses, but for me the overall feeling I got, especially close to the end, was hugely influenced by the supernatural. I’m not sure if the author would agree with this choice, since it’s not exactly ‘tribal’ music, but I went with what I imagined Jimin and his strange ‘aura’ to be like – almost inhumane, close to a Siren (Music name: Sirens of Pandora), and because it was Jimin who’s basically the guiding element and a huge influence for JK and also pretty much the reason he does what he does. Also, I wanted this video to be more of an auditory experience in general, visually too, but the auditory aspect was important for me to get right for sure. The author has this really vivid style of portraying scenes, and very vivid descriptions, so I aimed to reflect this fact in the video. Hence the 12 layers of sound effects (I’m not joking, I know you probably can’t tell, but trust me, I was close to flipping my shit), and this type of music (the singing voices esp.) was just perfect combining all sorts of sounds and blending (gun shots, machine gun shots + that techno music for dancing, police sirens and boat bell, seeping gas, Jimin singing + whale singing, ghost sounds, water sounds etc etc). I tried to depict that both JK an JM are very different, but yet a lot in common, hence the sort of linear storytelling, but switching the POVs both visually (e.g. through parallels) and through the voiceover. There are some double meanings. Obviously. Cuz no spoilers hopefully x).<br />Hope you like it, guys. Please, go give the author some love, she definitely deserves it ;)). And again, constructive criticism for the video welcomed ;).
