&quot;How can we truly love someone?<br /><br />In this loving and caring Dharma talk directed especially to lay practitioners, Sister Giac Nghiêm explores the meaning of &quot;true love&quot;. She shares that love is everywhere, all around us, in everything that is. Love is not just limited to the human experience. She speaks about the love parents have for their children. She explains how we, as practitioners, can look at our sexual energy with a kind gaze, and how we can mindfully engage in relationships. <br /><br />If and when we fall in love and wish to start a relationship, Sister Giac Nghiêm invites us to take our time to truly get to know the other person, and to recognize the feelings, emotions, and perceptions that come up in us. Our sister also encourages us to go further, and explores with us how to open our heart to include all beings in our practice of love. <br /><br />Enriched with memorable stories about our teacher Thay, this Dharma talk explores the four aspects of True Love (loving kindness, compassion, joy and inclusiveness), the difference between love and desire, the 4 Noble Truths, and the 3rd of the 5 Mindfulness Trainings (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings/)">https://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings/)</a><br /><br />Sister Giac Nghiêm is the abbess of the Maison de l'Inspir in Paris, and a senior Dharma teacher in the Plum Village tradition.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plumvillage.org/fr/monastics/dharma-teachers/soeur-giac-nghiem/">https://plumvillage.org/fr/monastics/dharma-teachers/soeur-giac-nghiem/</a><br /><br />*  *<br /><br />You can support us by:<br />- donating: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plumvillage.org/support">https://plumvillage.org/support</a><br />- helping to caption &amp; translate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amara.org/en/profiles/videos/plumvillage/">https://amara.org/en/profiles/videos/plumvillage/</a>
