Separated by the Danube River, the second-longest river in Europe, there actually remains a border dispute there between the two countries. And awkwardly sitting in between them is Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br /><br />Both used to be part of a country called Yugoslavia, and both went to war with each other after that country fell apart in the early 1990s. More on that in a bit. But overall, these two beautiful countries have a lot in common.<br /><br />Let’s first get this out of the way. Serbia has the province of Kosovo. Or does it? Kosovo actually declared independence from Serbia back in 2008, but Serbia doesn’t recognize it as a sovereign state. At the time of the making of this video, half of the United Nations member states recognize Kosovo as an independent country.<br /><br />Both have a continental climate and mediterrean climate. Both have mountains that greatly influence those climates. <br /><br />Croatia is split by the Dinaric Alps, and west of those mountains they got that nice and mild mediterrean climate and east of it can get a bit more hot and cold. Also in eastern Croatia all of a sudden you’re in the Great Hungarian Plain, or probably more accurately called the Pannonian Basin, with flatter land and fertile soil that’s great for farming. Serbia has some of that sweet Pannonian Basin farmland in the north, too, but also has lots of hills and is surrounded by multiple mountain ranges, including the aforementioned Dinaric Alps, the Serbian Carpathians, and Balkan Mountains. <br /><br />Both regularly get earthquakes. <br /><br />Both have capitals that are also the largest cities in each country. However, Belgrade is bigger than Zagreb. <br /><br />Both are parliamentary republics. Both used to have monarchies up to the 20th century. Hey, this reminds me. This video is a collaboration with Useful Charts, which just released a video about the family tree of Serbian royalty, as well as some Croatian kings. Be sure to check it out when you’re done watching this one.<br /><br />But anyway, yeah, today people vote for their governments in both countries. None of this being born into it crap. <br /><br />Both have about the same percentage of urban residents. (C- 57%, S- 56%)<br /><br />Both have relatively low crime compared to the rest of the world.<br /><br />Football, aka soccer, is the most popular sport in both. <br /><br />Rakia, this fruit brandy with a really high alcohol content, is a popular drink in both.<br /><br />The median age in both is higher than most countries, but is younger in Serbia. (C-43.1, S-40.5)<br /><br />#Serbia #Croatia #geography
