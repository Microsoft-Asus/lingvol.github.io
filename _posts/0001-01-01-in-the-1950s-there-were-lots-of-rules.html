To support my efforts to create more clips please donate to me at www.patreon.com/allinaday. This is a clip from a episode from my television series, Making Sense of the Sixties. My thesis was that it was largely the experiences that kids had in the 1950s that created many of the social and some of the political events that took place in the 1960s.  Other segments from the series are on my YouTube channel.  I do hope you enjoy this and find it thought-provoking.
