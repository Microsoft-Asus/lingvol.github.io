There’s not a huge amount of difference in these meanings but actually we’re interested in a marketing offering, so we’re not interested in something that is contributed as a religious sacrifice, we’re certainly not interested in human sacrifice, what we’re interested in is more a thing that is produced for entertainment or sale<br /><br />A more marketing specific definition of offering.<br /><br />We need a more marketing specific definition of an offering and we found one at AZ Central. What they tell us is that “an offering is more than the product itself, it includes elements that add value such as availability, delivery, support and quality.” This is a really important consideration when you consider your offering. What we are seeing here is that an offering is the whole package, the whole deal, and when you come to think about your pricing these are things that become very important.<br /><br />Why should you consider your offering?<br /><br />The question now becomes why do you need to consider your offering? Surely you know better than anyone what it is that you sell?<br /><br />The first issue here is about perspective. Because you work all day every day in your business you will have developed a vocabulary so you can talk and act efficiently around the issues that you address for your customers. However, that’s not to say just because you have a widget x3c b25 that your customers will think about it in exactly the same way. You need to be thinking about your offering, you need to be doing your keyword research that we spoke about in the last video and you need to make sure that you are presenting your offering in the way that people are searching for it.<br /><br />The second issue is about making it easy for people to buy. My recommendation is that you produce a menu of all of your products and services and all of the added value. What that does is make it really simple for people to see what you offer, how much you charge for those offerings and what buying them involves; it makes it easy for them to buy.<br />Once you have that the next step is product development. There was a study conducted in the UK where they found that it is 17 times more cost-effective to sell new products to your existing customers than it is to sell your existing products to new customers. You want to be thinking all the time, what else is it that we could be offering to the market.<br />What I’m going to show you now is how you can use Google autocomplete to see the questions that people asking Google about the products and services that you provide.<br />I’m hoping that you’re hearing me and you’re thinking “yeah, this sounds like a really good idea I need to assess my offering” and don’t worry we are assessing the way that we spell assess.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />.
