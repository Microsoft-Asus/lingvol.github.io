Today we decided to play a quick game of hide and seek in our vacation home! We headed to Arizona for the weekend for a little getaway. First up was dad as the seeker. Trinity had a really good hiding spot in mind but had to improvise at the last minute and ended up finding one even better. The tables turned for the next round and Madison found an excellent spot out in the garage by the lamborghini. Mom ended up winning round two with baby Preston!<br /><br />Check out our other Channels!!!<br />Beyond Family Vlogs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/beyondfamily">https://tinyurl.com/beyondfamily</a><br />Girls vs Boys Toys: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3IsdhojXIjTXuD1TPKgfrg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3IsdhojXIjTXuD1TPKgfrg</a><br /><br />Follow Us:<br />FaceBook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/trinityandbeyond">https://facebook.com/trinityandbeyond</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/trinityandbeyond.yt/">https://instagram.com/trinityandbeyond.yt/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TrinityBeyondYT">https://twitter.com/TrinityBeyondYT</a><br />TikTok: BeyondFamily.YT<br /><br />About Trinity and Beyond:<br />Hey guys!
