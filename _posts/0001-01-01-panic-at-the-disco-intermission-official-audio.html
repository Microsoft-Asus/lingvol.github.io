At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.<br /><br />Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices &amp; Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track &quot;Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released &quot;Say Amen (Saturday Night)&quot;, the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.<br /><br />#PanicAtTheDisco #Intermission #AFeverYouCantSweatOut #PATD #FueledbyRamen #OfficialAudio{% endraw %}
