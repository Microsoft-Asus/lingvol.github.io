{% raw %}HILARIOUS MOMENTS ONLY COUPLES CAN UNDERSTAND<br /><br /><br /><br />Things at the beginning of a relationship are a lot different than a month later. So in this video, I show you how things change, how other things stay the same and the difference between two people who’ve been together for so long. <br /><br />At first, you fight over who will give the last piece to the other person. A year later, you argue who will eat the last piece of cake. <br /><br />Another funny moment is when you order a salad at the beginning of the relationship at the restaurant. But a year later, you order the entire menu. <br /><br />I also show you what your relationship means through your sleeping position. When you move close to your partner's side, it means you need closeness. When you touch slightly (hands or feet) it means you need comfort and you’re also friends. <br /><br />The stargazing position means that there’s a strong connection between each other. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />0:07 -1 month vs 1 year<br /><br />4:31 – What your sleeping position says about your relationship<br /><br />5:21 – What spooning means<br /><br />6:04 – 1 year vs 40 years together<br /><br />10:33 – Freezing feet<br /><br />12:34 – Types of girls on dates <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
