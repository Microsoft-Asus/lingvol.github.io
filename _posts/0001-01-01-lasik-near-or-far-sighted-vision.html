Well, far vision for people who are nearsighted, is what LASIK was originally designed to do. The farsighted prescription where people have trouble reading, that's been over the last few years, developed. And so, now, people with farsightedness and astigmatism can actually be treated as well, and that came about in the last few years. So yes, people with problems up close can be treated, as well as the standard, people who have trouble far away.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Video Produced By: Definitive Productions | www.definitiveproductions.com
