Designer Dan Marentic shares a look inside his minimalist 685-square-foot condo that’s filled with smart storage ideas and space-saving solutions. See how he maximizes every square foot.<br /><br />“Though still very small, my new condo has considerably more head room than my sister’s garage (and it’s warmer!).  Many of the same storage challenges existed here, but I’ve tried to take advantage of every nook and cranny and add a few unique details as well,” says Dan. In the kitchen, additional storage hides bulky appliances, while a natural stone quartz island provides extra prep space. Multifunctional furniture increases seating in the small living room, where a mod fireplace and quirky artwork inject personality. Storage is maximized in the bedroom with custom built-ins, and the den doubles as as a second bedroom and home office thanks to a Murphy bed.<br /><br />WHERE TO BUY:<br />Kitchen: Custom island, Scavolini (color: Titanium Grey); Custom island stone, Ciot (color/type: Quarzo Bianco Precious Stone); Stools, MDF &quot;Flow&quot;; Light above island, Vibia &quot;Match 003&quot;; Wall hooks, Tom Dixon &quot;Knobs&quot;. <br />Living room: Couch, Morba; Pillows: Elte and (fabric from Designer Fabrics on Queen West); Rug, Flor &quot;Reoriented - Grey&quot;; Coffee table, Elte; Chairs, BoConcept &quot;Adelaide Chair&quot;; Metallic stool, West Elm; Fireplace: Vauni &quot;Cupola&quot;; Black Console, Pavilion; Black side tables, Pavilion; Salvaged wood stool, Urban Tree Salvage. <br />Bedroom: Bedroom art (clouds), Sygns &quot;Cloud 9&quot;; Bed, Brothers Dressler (finish: graphite ash); Bedding/chunky throw, Winners / West Elm; Bed pillows, Fairmont Hotels; Side tables, CB2 (left-side, attached to the wall); Brothers Dressler (right-side, attached to the bed); Sliding doors, Rimadesio; Custom storage, Organized Interiors. <br />Bathroom: Medicine cabinet, Wet; Den: Custom storage/murphy bed, Organized Interiors; Office chair, Morba; Pivot door, Rimadesio.
