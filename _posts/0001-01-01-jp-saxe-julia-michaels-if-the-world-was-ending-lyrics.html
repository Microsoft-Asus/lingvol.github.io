Right?<br />If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?<br /><br />[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]<br />I tried to imagine your reaction<br />It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened<br />But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'<br />Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen<br />Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how<br />How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe &amp; Julia Michaels]<br />And I know you know we know you weren't<br />Down for forever and it's fine<br />I know you know we know we weren't<br />Meant for each other and it's fine<br /><br />[Chorus: JP Saxe &amp; Julia Michaels]<br />But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br />You'd come over and you'd stay the night<br />Would you love me for the hell of it?<br />All our fears would be irrelevant<br />If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br />Sky'd be falling while I hold you tight<br />No, there wouldn't be a reason why<br />We would even have to say goodbye<br />If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br />You'd come over, right?<br />You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]<br />I know you know we know you weren't<br />Down for forever and it's fine<br />I know you know we know we weren't<br />Meant for each other and it's fine<br /><br />[Chorus: JP Saxe &amp; Julia Michaels]<br />But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br />You'd come over and you'd stay the night<br />Would you love me for the hell of it?<br />All our fears would be irrelevant<br />If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br />The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight<br />No, there wouldn't be a reason why<br />We would even have to say goodbye<br />If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br />You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?<br /><br />[Outro: JP Saxe &amp; Julia Michaels]<br />Hmm<br />If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br /><br /><br />Tags: #JPSaxe #JuliaMichaels #IfTheWorldWasEnding<br /><br /><br />Ethereal Music is striving to bring you the best music from up and coming artists/producers.
