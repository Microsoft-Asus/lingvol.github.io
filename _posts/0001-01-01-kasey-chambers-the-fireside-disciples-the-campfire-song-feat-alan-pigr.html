{% raw %}The Campfire Song is taken from Kasey Chambers &amp; The Fireside Disciples’ album Campfire, available now at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://warner.link/kaseycampfireas.">https://warner.link/kaseycampfireas.</a> The Fireside Disciples consists of three of Kasey’s favourite musicians: Brandon Dodd, who has toured the world with Kasey over the last three years; Alan Pigram, a long-time family friend, fellow musician (from the renowned band The Pigram Brothers) and Indigenous elder from Broome WA; and her dad, Bill Chambers. Campfire is an album that Kasey has wanted to make her whole life. The album represents the connection she’s had to different lands and cultures throughout her life, and drawing from the regions that have influenced her the most – Australia, Africa, Norfolk Island and America.<br /><br />Directed by The Filmery{% endraw %}
