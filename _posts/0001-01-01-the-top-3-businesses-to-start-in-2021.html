A Capitalist is a visionary type of entrepreneur. While some feel entitled to what belongs to others, we take responsibility for solving problems that we did not create. Whether it‚Äôs a global crisis or just an empty bank account, we take ownership for creating change, and we are already hard at work.<br /><br />We don‚Äôt post just our lifestyle on Instagram or succeed to look good to other people. A Capitalist doesn‚Äôt have to win at the expense of others; no, a Capitalist works with others to create new opportunities that didn‚Äôt exist before, and the byproduct is profit. That‚Äôs why we embrace being part of the One Percent, because we are willing to outwork and outserve the other 99. <br /><br />We know that if you want to change the world, we must first change ourselves. It doesn‚Äôt happen overnight; it starts by serving others and doing the work day after day after day. If you want to create change, it starts with you. So while the world debates, we create. We take responsibility. We solve problems. We build businesses. We create opportunity. And we proudly produce profit. <br /><br />They can judge us, debate us, even blame us and try to tax us, but without us, there would be no change. We are Capitalists, and we create change.<br /><br /><br />Website ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://capitalism.com">http://capitalism.com</a><br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br /><br />If you found this video valuable, give it a thumbs up (it really does help).<br />If you know someone who needs to see it, share it (sharing is caring).<br />Leave a comment below with your thoughts (we love a good conversation).<br />Add it to a playlist if you want to watch it later (or to watch it twice).<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The information contained on this YouTube Channel and the resources available for download/viewing through this YouTube Channel are for educational and informational purposes only.
