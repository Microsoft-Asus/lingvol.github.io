{% raw %}Aggravating Factors (s3c)<br />The death penalty may be imposed only if a jury finds an “aggravating factor,” and, once one is found, aggravating factors are considered in deciding whether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment.  The purpose of aggravating factors is to narrow the crimes for which death may be imposed to the worst ones.  This segment examines the degree to which the aggravating factors serve these purposes, and whether some may be so vague that they do not limit imposition of the death penalty to the most heinous crimes.<br /><br />Class readings: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AAAFpGMOJfIupw67qtY_DwTVa/Class%203/Class%203%20Part%202%20-%20Aggravating%20Circumstances.pdf?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AAAFpGMOJfIupw67qtY_DwTVa/Class%203/Class%203%20Part%202%20-%20Aggravating%20Circumstances.pdf?dl=0</a>{% endraw %}
