This powerful live performance of “Teach Your Children” from Adelaide, Australia, features Tula, Roberto Luti and the PFC Band. Years ago when we started recording Songs Around The World together like “One Love” and “Chanda Mama” we never imagined we would be growing a global movement supporting musicians and music education across the globe, but this is the power of music. Today’s live performance embodies all that we believe in: soulful music with an inspiring message helping us to move forward as a human race, one heart and one song at a time.<br /><br />PFC3: Songs Around The World - CD/DVD available everywhere now! <br />Featuring 185 musicians from 31 different countries: <br />Buy PFC3 Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2byKeXe">http://bit.ly/2byKeXe</a><br />Buy on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/PFC3AmCD">http://smarturl.it/PFC3AmCD</a><br />Buy PFC3 on iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/PFC3itunes">http://smarturl.it/PFC3itunes</a><br /><br />JOIN THE MOVEMENT<br />Subscribe to our newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1x9CAfJ">http://bit.ly/1x9CAfJ</a><br />Join us as a YouTube Member here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn25nZ12HEZq_w_m_1DmbbA/sponsor">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn25nZ12HEZq_w_m_1DmbbA/sponsor</a><br /><br />GET SOCIAL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PlayingForChange">https://www.facebook.com/PlayingForChange</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/playing4change">https://twitter.com/playing4change</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/playing4change">http://instagram.com/playing4change</a><br />See the PFC Band live: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playingforchange.com/events">https://www.playingforchange.com/events</a><br /><br />To learn more about the work of the PFC Foundation, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.playingforchange.org">http://www.playingforchange.org</a>
