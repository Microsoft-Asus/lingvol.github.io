The album is a series of snapshots taken at different points as I’ve processed moving to a new country, getting married, traveling to different places. I’ve also experienced the pain of loss. We unexpectedly and suddenly had to say goodbye to Maddy’s Mom Carme at the end of 2018. I’ve had to rapidly learn how to love and stand by Maddy as we process this pain. We live in a world with so much going on. I think it’s important to have a safe place where you can go to catch your breath, process life and grow.  Lailonie has been that place for me. I hope it can be that place for you.” <br /><br />‘Lailonie’ features collaborations from a wide array of talented artists including organic house music producer Wassu, soulful, jazzy vocalist Leo Wood, UK producer Phenoir, Cincinnati-based vocalist Mariel Beausejour, Austin-based songstress Mimi Page, and progressive house producer Forerunners. <br /><br />Marsh’s music has been supported by the likes of Joris Voorn, Kölsch and Rufus Du Sol, along with Pete Tong, Danny Howard and Phil Taggart at BBC Radio 1. On the live side, Marsh has performed at esteemed venues on both sides of the Atlantic, including Printworks London and The Brooklyn Mirage.  <br />With ‘Lailonie’ Marsh continues to tell his story of healing and inner peace through his enchantingly deep and progressive sound, and looks set to follow in the footsteps of fellow Anjunadeep alumni such as Lane 8, Yotto and Ben Böhmer on his rise to the top of the dance music world. <br /><br />‘Lailonie’ is out now on Anjunadeep.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Follow Anjunadeep:<br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/DeepSubcc">http://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/DeepSubcc</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.anjunadeep.com">http://www.anjunadeep.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep">http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/anjunadeep">http://www.twitter.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/NewReleasesYo/spotify">https://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/NewReleasesYo/spotify</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep">http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep">http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/AboveandBeyond/">https://reddit.com/r/AboveandBeyond/</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/anjuna">https://www.twitch.tv/anjuna</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.discord.gg/anjuna">http://www.discord.gg/anjuna</a>{% endraw %}
