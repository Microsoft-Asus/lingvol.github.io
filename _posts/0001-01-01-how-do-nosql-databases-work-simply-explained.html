NoSQL databases power some of the biggest sites. They're fast and super scalable but how do they work?<br /><br />Behind-the-scenes, they use a keyspace to distribute your data across multiple servers or partitions. This allows them to scale horizontally across many thousand servers.<br /><br />NoSQL databases can operate in multiple modes: as key-value store, document store or wide column store.<br /><br />You can run your own NoSQL database with software like Cassandra, CouchDB, MongoDB or Scylla. You can also use a cloud version like AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud BigTable or Azure CosmosDB.<br /><br />üåç Social<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Savjee">https://twitter.com/Savjee</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/Savjee">https://facebook.com/Savjee</a><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://savjee.be">https://savjee.be</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è  Become a Simply Explained member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ/join</a><br /><br />üìö Sources used to make this video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://savjee.be/videos/simply-explained/how-do-nosql-databases-work/">https://savjee.be/videos/simply-explained/how-do-nosql-databases-work/</a>
