{% raw %}All parents get angry at their children.  But there are hugely more effective ways to discipline than anger.  Kim Constable, radical unschooling mother of four, discusses how disciplining with anger actually has the opposite effect to the one you want.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kim Constable is a vegan eating, yoga teaching, online entrepreneur and unschooling advocate.  She believes that children deserve the same respect, freedom and rights as adults.  She teaches how arbitrary rules that we force upon children, are designed to meet the needs of the adult, not the child.  Kim and her husband Ryan exist in partnership with their children, allowing them to live in freedom.  Her kids do not attend school and do not participate in any kind of forced learning.  Instead they are free to pursue their passions as sources of learning, living life with joy and purpose.<br /><br /><br /><br />@deyogatox<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
