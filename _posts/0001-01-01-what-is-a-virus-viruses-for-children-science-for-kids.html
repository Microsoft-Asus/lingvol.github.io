{% raw %}Educational video for children to learn what viruses are and how they spread. Viruses are microorganisms that are not visible in plain sight; we'd need a microscope to see them. Did you know that viruses are not living organisms? This is because unlike cells, viruses cannot carry out the vital function of reproduction by themselves. In this video, children will discover what the structure of a virus is (capsid and genetic material) and also how viruses spread. Children will understand what vaccines are and what they are for, and they will look at some examples of diseases caused by viruses. This video is an excellent resource for elementary school, Grades 5 and 6, but it also helps the littles ones understand what microorganisms like the coronavirus are, and how they can avoid getting infected by having good hygiene habits like hand washing. <br /><br />Thanks for visiting us!
