Tolkien's poems, &quot;All That Is Gold Does Not Glitter ~ Seek For The Sword That Was Brokenl!&quot;  We hope you enjoy it:)<br /><br />Album Art: Our original work<br /><br />A note on our interpretation:<br /><br />This piece expresses the mission of Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings, not in its fulfillment in the kingship of Gondor and Arnor, but in its inception in the days of darkness and doubt. Its centerpieces are the two short poems, “All that is gold does not glitter,” which expresses Aragorn’s lineage, and “Seek for the Sword that was broken,” which expresses his relationship to the One Ring of Sauron. <br /><br />In the text of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo hears the verse “All that is gold does not glitter” on two occasions: first in the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree (Book 1, Chapter 10) and again in the Council of Elrond (Book 2, Chapter 2). On the second occasion it immediately follows the recitation by Boromir of the dream, “Seek for the Sword that was broken.” Hence the structure of this song. <br /><br />The other two elements in the piece express the relationship of Arwen to Aragorn’s mission, in which for the second time in the history of Middle Earth, in a manner that looks back explicitly to the first, the races of Men and Elves are brought together. This element is expressed by the words “Arwen vanimelda, namarië!” spoken by Aragorn at the end of Book 2, Chapter 6, and by the words “Farewell sweet earth and northern sky!” spoken by Beren of Luthien in Chapter 19 of the Silmarillion. Note the adaptation of those words from the morning star of the Elves to their Evenstar.<br /><br /><br />We hope that you enjoy this song!  <br /><br />We are unable to get permission to sell this song so we are posting it here free for your enjoyment.  If you want a copy of the mp3, we are offering it to those who support us on Patreon!<br /><br />My brother composed and arranged the piece.  My family sang it.<br /><br />Please no bad language in the comments.  We want this to be family friendly:)<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />All that is gold does not glitter,<br />Not all those who wander are lost;<br />The old that is strong does not wither,<br />Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br />From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,<br />A light from the shadows shall spring;<br />Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br />The crownless again shall be king.<br /><br />Seek for the Sword that was broken:<br />In Imladris it dwells;<br />There shall be counsels taken<br />Stronger than Morgul-spells.<br />There shall be shown a token<br />That Doom is near at hand,<br />For Isildur's Bane shall waken,<br />And the Halfling forth shall stand.
