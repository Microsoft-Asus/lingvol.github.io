Ringo is still the most underrated drummer in Rock. This humble tribute is meant to illustrate the importance of Ringo Starr's unique drum work for the Beatles. <br /><br />First of all, I need to get the credits right: Big thanks to Johnny Silver and Ian Watts for giving me permission to use their recordings for my sound samples. <br /><br />Johnny Silver is one of the world’s finest John Lennon impersonators. He founded ‘The Silver Beatles’ more than 20 years ago. My dad joined his band in May 1999, the month I was born and he was with the Silver Beatles for as long as 10 years. <br /><br />That’s the reason why Milena and I literally grew up with Beatles music. Ian Watts was with the Silver Beatles basically between 2002 and 2007. Yes, Ian is the producer of the Nursery Rhyme Collection that I started introducing every Tuesday. No, it's not a coincidence that some of those Nursery Rhymes feature a Beatlesque sound. Drummer on the Original Recordings was Steve Heappey (sorry Steve for erasing your parts, they were excellent!) <br /><br />The keyboard solos for ‘In My Life’ and ‘Come Together’ were played by… right, Rick Benbow. He also played on 'Strawberry Fields'<br /><br />Johnny Silver (John's parts)<br />Ian Watts (Paul's parts)<br />Mike Wilbury (George's parts)<br />Sina (Ringo's parts)<br /><br />Rick Benbow (Keyboards for ‘Strawberry Fields’, ‘In My Life’ ‘Come Together’, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', 'Something')<br /><br />This is the official 'Silver Beatles' Website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://silverbeatles.jimdo.com/">https://silverbeatles.jimdo.com/</a><br /><br />The Silver Beatles’ Recordings are available on Spotify, they are launched under the name<br /><br />‘The Beatles Recovered Band’:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cBV24PM5nZsXqopSHvdtS?si=nBIYnbUzQNWEl7WoEHik4Q">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cBV24PM5nZsXqopSHvdtS?si=nBIYnbUzQNWEl7WoEHik4Q</a><br />_______________________<br /><br />Now for the videos that I referred to:<br /><br />Ringo talks about his left-handed drumming and some confusion this caused:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vl9188EPdLI">https://youtu.be/vl9188EPdLI</a><br /><br />Daniel Glass explains the influence of Ringo on a young generation of drummers after 1964<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BsXxTo1qa-0">https://youtu.be/BsXxTo1qa-0</a><br />_______________________<br /><br />This is a the Full Cover of ‘Come Together’ by Lucy Gowen &amp; Clarissa Mae<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iCyuqEtEaNA">https://youtu.be/iCyuqEtEaNA</a><br /><br />This is a the Full Cover of ‘Here Comes The Sun’ by Lauren Isenberg &amp; Aja9<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OWf4v85A8Qs">https://youtu.be/OWf4v85A8Qs</a><br /><br />This is a the Full Cover of ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ by Lauren Isenberg<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cFL0CqJK_yY">https://youtu.be/cFL0CqJK_yY</a><br /><br />This is a the Full Cover of ‘Something’ by Avonlea<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gmcjuZRGOfM">https://youtu.be/gmcjuZRGOfM</a><br /><br />On another note, I was approached by Simon Weitzman who is working on a Beatles Fan Project, featuring footage of Beatles fans all around the globe, paying Tribute to the Beatles and I’m very excited that I might be featured in the movie.
