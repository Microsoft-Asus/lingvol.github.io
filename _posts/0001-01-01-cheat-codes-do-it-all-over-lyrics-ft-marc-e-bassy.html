Bassy]<br />At your doorstep, say I'm leavin'<br />Like it's the end but I'm lyin' to myself, oh, oh<br />You say you're hurtin', I say we'll be friends<br />It's dÃ©jÃ  vu again, and I'm lyin' to myself<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />'Cause I hate when I wish I can let you go<br />I'm dyin', I'm dyin' to hold you<br />And I hate when you call and I hold you close<br />Like God know it's already over<br />Maybe it's you, maybe it's me<br />Wish I could work it out in my head<br />Maybe I will, maybe I won't<br />Maybe I'll do it, do it, I'll do it all again<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />Do it all over, do it all over, all over again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, do it again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, all over again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, do it again<br /><br />[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]<br />I've blocked your number, delÐµte the photos<br />I got a routine, yÐµah, it helps me to forget, oh na-na<br />All the bad shit, I wanna let it slide<br />A couple weeks go by and you're right back in my bed<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />'Cause I hate when I wish I can let you go<br />I'm dyin', I'm dyin' to hold you<br />And I hate when you call and I hold you close<br />Like God know it's already over<br />Maybe it's you, maybe it's me<br />Wish I could work it out in my head<br />Maybe I will, maybe I won't<br />Maybe I'll do it, do it, I'll do it all again<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />Do it all over, do it all over, all over again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, do it again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, all over again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, do it again<br /><br />[Bridge: Marc E. Bassy]<br />Do it again<br />(Do it again)<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />'Cause I hate when I wish I can let you go<br />I'm dyin', I'm dyin' to hold you<br />And I hate when you call and I hold you close<br />Like God know it's already over<br />Maybe it's you, maybe it's me<br />Wish I could work it out in my head<br />Maybe I will, maybe I won't<br />Maybe I'll do it, do it, I'll do it all again<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />Do it all over, do it all over, all over again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, do it again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, all over again<br />Do it all over, do it all over, do it again<br /><br />[Outro: Marc E.
