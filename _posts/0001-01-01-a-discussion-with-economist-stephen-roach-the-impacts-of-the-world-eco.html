Ed Butowsky, managing partner of Chapwood Investments, LLC has the unique ability to recognize how current events affect investment portfolios. <br /><br />For over 25 years, Ed Butowsky and the Chapwood Investments team have helped high net-worth clients by bringing clarity and understanding to their portfolios by targeting specific rates of return to meet their long-term needs. Chapwood Investments was formed for one simple reason: To help clients understand and give perspective and knowledge of what they already have in their portfolios.<br /><br />Most clients have no idea what it is that they own and what they should expect from what they own. So, Chapwood Investments was built to give people that knowledge.
