Secularization has meant not mainly the decline of religion (although in many countries this has been a consequence )—but, rather, the pluralization of religious, or spiritual positions, and the creation of a culture of ecumenical exchange, which is very different from what obtained half a century ago. Professor Taylor examines this development and contrasts it to another religious development, viz., the use of religion as a marker of political identity and mobilization, frequently accompanied by conflict and violence. This bifurcation of religious belonging into two utterly opposed tendencies is a crucial feature of our times.<br /><br />Professor Rajeev Bhargava joined the Institute for Social Justice (ACU) as a Professorial Fellow in 2014 and is currently Professor at the Center for the Study of Developing societies.
