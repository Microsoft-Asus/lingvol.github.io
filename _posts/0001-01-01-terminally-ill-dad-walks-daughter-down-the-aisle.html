Danielle Connelly's biggest wish on her wedding day was to have her father, Martin, 56, in attendance, but in the months prior to her big day, on October 10, Martin's health began to deteriorate. The 56-year-old was originally admitted to hospital on June 19 after having a hemorrhagic stroke. Martin then suffered another stroke three days later, which required brain surgery. Doctors at Grand River Hospital, in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, then discovered a tumor in Martin's esophagus, which has since progressed to Stage 4. Danielle, 29, said she has always been a &quot;daddy's girl,&quot; and so she spoke to hospital staff about what might be possible, given Martin's condition. Initially, it was suggested that a small wedding could take place in the ICU â€“ but doctors and social carers later suggested it would be easier to arrange such a ceremony outside. Working with her now-husband, Ben Maloy, 33, and an event planner, Danielle started to arrange parking for guests, musicians, tables, decoration and social distancing. After three days of preparation â€“ and with decorations set up by social workers â€“ the musical therapy department played as Danielle walked down the aisle. <br /><br />----<br /><br />Happily is home to feel good news guaranteed to put a smile on your face.
