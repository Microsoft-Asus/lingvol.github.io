TWICE &quot;I CAN'T STOP ME&quot; M/V » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CM4CkVFmTds">https://youtu.be/CM4CkVFmTds</a><br /><br />Today, we are going to be reviewing Twice’s comeback with I can’t stop me, and talk about my thoughts, why it’s familiar, why it’s not familiar and honestly everything in between. Jokes will be made, but I will make sure to clearly point them out.<br /><br />Ok, so this music video starts out with this beautiful scene and it features this seemingly floating platform with a beautiful platform that reflects the stars and this flower in the middle. It then opens up and twice is inside. Now I don’t know if you remember my last review, but I expressed how I wish we could have explored this fake type of island they were on in more and more and I think we got to do that here. And so, we shall venture into why it’s familiar. To me this is like a continuation of more and more, you know that song gave us a glimpse into this world, and now we get to dive even more further into it. I mean we see this cliff, these colorful types of mountains that they are dancing on. We just get to see a universe that doesn’t exist but that they created. And then it ends with their train almost going off a cliff, so maybe we’ll get a more and more part 3 within this universe.<br /><br />#TWICE #Eyeswideopen #ICANTSTOPME<br /><br />_________________<br /><br /><br />become a COCKA2 by subscribing to my channel 'angelina' &amp; hit the bell for more kpop shenanigans » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Boj1bW">https://bit.ly/2Boj1bW</a><br /><br />🌼 CONNECT WITH ME 🌼<br />MEMBERSHIPS » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2WNCVWo">https://bit.ly/2WNCVWo</a><br />INSTAGRAM » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moluccensis/">https://www.instagram.com/moluccensis/</a><br />2ND CHANNEL » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/angelina2">https://www.youtube.com/c/angelina2</a><br />BUSINESS » minjivanpark@gmail.com<br /><br />🌼 AFFILIATE LINKS 🌼<br /><br />COKODIVE Kpop Albums | Use Code “ANGELINA” FOR 10% Off!*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cokodive.com/?aff=560">http://cokodive.com/?aff=560</a><br /><br />ExpressVPN | Get 3 Months FREE!*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.expressvpn.com/angelina">https://www.expressvpn.com/angelina</a>  <br /><br />YESSTYLE | Use Code “PARROT10” FOR 10% Off!*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ys.style/1DE0b4mPY8">https://ys.style/1DE0b4mPY8</a><br /><br />*disclosure: the links above are affiliate links, meaning that I will earn commission if you click through and make a purchase!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />🌼 CREDITS 🌼<br />OUTRO »  vhs - montreal <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sDTJU2Aqhlg">https://youtu.be/sDTJU2Aqhlg</a><br /><br />FUNKY TRANSITION » Kpop Shake<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3672GCK">https://bit.ly/3672GCK</a><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:34 MV Intro Description<br />2:13 Why It's Familiar<br />3:05 Ateez/Blackpink/2NE1<br />6:10 The Song<br />6:59 The Outfits<br />7:40 MV Theory<br />10:07 Choreography<br />11:09 Additional Thoughts<br /><br /><br />[ Angelina ]
