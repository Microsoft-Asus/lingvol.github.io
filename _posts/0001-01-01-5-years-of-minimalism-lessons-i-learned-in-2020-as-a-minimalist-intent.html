in today's video, I want to share some important lessons I have learned from being a minimalist for five years and also some learnings I especially had in 2020 when it comes to living a fulfilled minimalist life. 2020 has forced a lot of us to slow down, stay at home, and build a fulfilling or just bearable routine and surroundings. I want to explain what this has taught me about myself and how I want my life to be now and in the future. this year gave me the right push to look closer to my everyday life to find out what actually adds value and makes life beautiful every single day.<br /><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ecofriend.lia/">https://www.instagram.com/ecofriend.lia/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#minimalism #minimalist
