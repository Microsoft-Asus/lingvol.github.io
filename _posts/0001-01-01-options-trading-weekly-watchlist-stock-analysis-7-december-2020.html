During the Weekly Watchlist we review the best stocks for options trading. We go over key levels of support and resistance and create an actionable game plan for the week ahead.<br /><br />► 1-on-1 GUIDANCE CALLS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tradebrigade.co/1-on-1/">https://tradebrigade.co/1-on-1/</a><br /><br />► SWING TRADE NEWSLETTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tradebrigade.co">https://tradebrigade.co</a><br />► USE THIS BROKER FOR INVESTING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m1.finance/LjyOHWmOSxEu">https://m1.finance/LjyOHWmOSxEu</a><br />► INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tradebrigade.co">https://www.instagram.com/tradebrigade.co</a><br />► DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/MNykREw">https://discord.gg/MNykREw</a><br /><br />The SPY is starting to break out of a weekly bull flag consolidation as well as a three-week balance area that is sitting on top of a longer term balance. We talk about the concept of the market moving from balance to excess and back to balance, and with the most recent break, we are expecting more excess to the upside. With blue skies ahead of us, this is not the time to be initiating new longs that will last out side of the day time frame, but also not the time to be trying to time a top.<br /><br />One concern is that the QQQ is sitting at all time highs however our major tech companies are mainly sitting right at the 50% mark of their most recent ranges. We can attribute some of this to TSLA soaring to all time highs on the S&amp;P inclusion news, however, something isn't quite adding up.<br /><br />This was also the week of reckoning for EV and green energy stocks which we cover partially in the quick fire round. We cover the following stock tickers: NIO, CHWY, JD, INTC, FSLY, SPCE, SBE, MU, CRM, MCD.<br /><br />0:00 – Intro<br />0:40 – Broad Market<br />09:05 – Core Companies<br />20:50 – Bonus Companies<br /><br />If you're a day trader looking to make fast money online, you certainly need to keep these areas of support and resistance in mind, as well as any technical patterns, before the opening bell on Monday morning. Stock analysis like this will save you a ton of time.<br /><br />Going into the day with a plan is important and will give your options trading the edge you need to be a successful retail day trader. This stock analysis gives you that edge.<br /><br />Instead of looking at stock market news and googling 'stocks to trade today' or best options to buy today, every Monday morning, technical analysis makes my job a lot easier. A quick glance at the stock chart can tell me where to expect buying and selling battles. <br /><br />SPY QQQ IWM AAPL NFLX TSLA BABA FB NVDA MSFT AMZN — These are the stocks that are always on our options trading weekly watchlist. Some people call them hot stock picks but we like to call them our ATM.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The information provided in this video is for informational purposes only.
