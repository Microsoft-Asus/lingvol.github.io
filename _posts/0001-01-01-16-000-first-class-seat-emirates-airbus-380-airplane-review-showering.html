Flying First Class In My Own Bedroom w/ A Shower // Reviewing The Flight Of A Lifetime // The Lounge, Food, Amenities, Cost, &amp; What A Shower Looks Like at 40,000 Feet<br /><br />Hi Guys,<br /><br />Are any of you curious how I get upgraded so much? If you are, text me or leave me a comment letting me know that you’d like to see a video on this! Oh and make sure to subscribe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KzihS5">https://bit.ly/2KzihS5</a> - I really appreciate your support! <br /><br />Wow, I wanted to share this with you guys as quickly as I could. I traveled so much these past few years which means I’ve been saving my points for a special occasion! How many of you who travel often have your reward accounts set up? If you don’t let me know and I can help you figure out how to maximize your travel benefits so you don’t miss the chance to earn points! <br /><br />I luckily had enough points upgrade myself to experience something that I’d only seen in Casey Neistat’s video’s… FIRST CLASS. I’ve been lucky enough to travel on some amazing airlines, but I don’t think anything has been as over the top as this experience.<br /><br />Anyway I want to take a second to talk about something that is going on all over the world. The Corona virus has been spreading globally and I hope everyone here is healthy. I hope you’re loved ones are okay and I’m praying that this ends soon. In the meantime I really hope everyone is staying safe, washing your hands, eating well, sleeping enough (helps your immune system), and taking the necessary steps to keep yourself healthy.<br /><br />I’m going to start sharing some content around ways to improve your immune system this month and we’ll be back to posting twice a week! I hope all of you have subscribed today and for any new comers, I hope you leave me a comment down below. If you want to text me ask someone in the community below or go my last few videos and you’ll find all the information in the description.<br /><br />Sending you all my love today!<br /><br />xx<br /><br />Sanne<br /><br />p.s. catching up on all my texts... have you texted me yet? if you do please please please send me your contact card filled out with you hometown, birthday (not year), email, and IG account handle!<br /><br />Follow me!<br />Instagram: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)">https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)</a><br />Twitter: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)">https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)</a><br />Subscribe!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KzihS5">https://bit.ly/2KzihS5</a>
