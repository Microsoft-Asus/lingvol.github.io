The copyrights goes to Metallica! I did NOT make the song or in any way own it. I don't in any way make any money of the song or the video.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Make his fight on the hill in the early day<br /><br />Constant chill deep inside<br /><br />Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey<br /><br />On the fight, for they are right, yes, by whos to say?<br /><br />For a hill men would kill, why? they do not know<br /><br />Suffered wounds test there their pride<br /><br />Men of five, still alive through the raging glow<br /><br />Gone insane from the pain that they surely know<br /><br />[chorus:]<br /><br />For whom the bell tolls<br /><br />Time marches on<br /><br />For whom the bell tolls<br /><br /><br /><br />Take a look to the sky just before you die<br /><br />It is the last time you will<br /><br />Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky<br /><br />Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry<br /><br />Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery<br /><br />He hears the silence so loud<br /><br />Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be<br /><br />Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see<br /><br />[chorus]<br /><br /><br /><br />Thx for watching :D
