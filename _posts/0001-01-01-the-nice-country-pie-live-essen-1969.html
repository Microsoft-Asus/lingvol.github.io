A black and white clip of The Nice, performing Bob Dylan's Country Pie  at the Song Days Festival in Essen, Germany, on October11th, 1969. I know this track from their Five Bridges album, but this version seems a little slower and with just a bit more swing. The sound is mixed a little in favour of Emerson, with Lee Jackson's vocals being lowest in the mix (probably few complaints there right?) and the eternally underrated Brian Davidson's drums being pretty audible at all times. Love that overdriven organ tone. I quite liked what The Nice had going on, with Davidson's jazzy drumming having a swing and, dare I say groove, missing from Carl Palmer's technical chatter. Lee Jackson's elastic Vox bass tone was a million miles away from the more conventional Fender bass tones of the day. Emerson clearly had his sight on higher matters, dragging classical repertoire into the rock field and deftly throwing in quotes left right and centre. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto appears on this Bob Dylan cover!
