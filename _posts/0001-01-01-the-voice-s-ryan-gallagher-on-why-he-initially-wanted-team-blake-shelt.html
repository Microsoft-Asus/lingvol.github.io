{% raw %}Behind The Velvet Rope with David Yontef<br />FULL INTERVIEW ON APPLE PODCASTS: The Voice's Ryan Gallagher (Team Kelly Clarskson): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-voices-ryan-gallagher-team-kelly-clarskson/id1496557812?i=1000502037144">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-voices-ryan-gallagher-team-kelly-clarskson/id1496557812?i=1000502037144</a><br /><br />The Voice’s Ryan Gallagher steps Behind The Rope. Ryan is having a major moment right now having wowed the judges with a leave them speechless audition on the top NBC hit show, “The Voice”. An audition which had judges Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton turning around their chairs to see the man behind the soulful operatic voice. The man is Ryan Gallagher, a classically trained vocalist who got his start in the music industry singing backup for world renowned singer Josh Groban. Speaking of music icons, Ryan has also shared the stage with the likes of Carrie Underwood and Michael Bolton. Of course, we needed to hear about that they are really like. We also needed to hear all about the behind the scenes inner workings of “The Voice” and real truths about their famed judges Kelly Clarkson, whose team he ultimately ended up on (good choice, Ryan!), Blake Shelton, John Legend and last, but certainly not least, Gwen Stefani. We also needed to hear all about the filing process, eliminations and guest judges such as Usher. If you think you recognize Ryan’s name it could be because he was also a contestant on “American Idol” in the past. It could also be because he was a cast member on the hit MTV show, “Ex On The Beach”. We discuss reality TV with Ryan, his current place in “The Voice” competition and what would happen, as we get down to the final weeks, if he really won. Fingers crossed!
