{% raw %}Minecraft, But We Can Only See One Chunk... This was INSANE! We couldn't even see where we were going...<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken">https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken</a><br /><br />Follow my socials:<br />➽ Twitter - @dreamwastaken<br />➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken<br />➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic<br /><br />George: @GeorgeNotFound <br />Sapnap: @Sapnap <br /><br />This is a custom coded 1.16 survival challenge. My friends and I try and beat the game while not being able to see outside of the chunk we are in. The chunks aren't being deleted or falling, but they are invisible! This is a custom coded mod by us. This was super intense, and insanely funny and fun.<br /><br />Can we beat the enderdragon?<br /><br />Want to see this again? Like the video and we might make this type of video a series!{% endraw %}
