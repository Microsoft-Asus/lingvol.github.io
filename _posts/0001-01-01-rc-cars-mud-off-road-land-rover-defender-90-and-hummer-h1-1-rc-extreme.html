If there`s no mud, off road trail track is built of stones, sand and wood. These small-sized off road cars can drive in a deep mud and puddle with no difficulty. At the same time, RC cars look like real off road 4x4 cars and 6x6 trucks such as Toyota Tundra, Hummer H2, Dodge RAM, MAN KAT 6x6, Land Rover DEFENDER that are very strong and powerful. Sometimes it`s difficult to understand if it`s an RC car or the real truck. The main manufacturers of these models are RC Axial, Tamiya, RC4WD, HPI. I suggest to watch this video as RC cars drive through mud and off road.<br />People call these models of RC trucks as toys for adults because they are quite expensive. The set of RC truck with the car, the battery, electronics and a charger costs about $500.<br /><br />My social networks:<br />Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?...">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?...</a><br /><br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wilimovich/">https://www.instagram.com/wilimovich/</a><br /><br />Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/wilimovich">https://twitter.com/wilimovich</a><br /><br />VK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vk.com/id346168233">https://vk.com/id346168233</a><br /><br />Livejournal<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wilimovich.livejournal.com/">http://wilimovich.livejournal.com/</a><br /><br />[Specification]<br />Axial SCX10 - Jeep Wrangler Rubicon (Kit)<br />Motor&amp;ESC: Novak Timbuk2 18.5T System<br />Wheel Beadlock  - Jeep JK Stock 1.9 Scale<br />Tires - Interco IROK 1.9 Scale<br />Pin: 20<br />Spur: 87<br />Bat - Turnigy Nano-Tech 6000mAh<br />Radio System - Futaba 4PL<br />MEGABEC 8 - Turnigy<br /><br />Axial Wraith - kit<br />Tires - HPI Racing Rock Grabber Tire S Compnd 2.2<br />Motor&amp;ESC: Novak Timbuk2 13.5T System Wraith Edition<br />Pin: 15<br />Spur: 87<br /><br />The Beast 6x6 RC4WD - Tamiya Globe Liner Semi Truck 1/14 - body<br />Weight 9 kg<br />Axle - Blackwell 2.5T;<br />Tires - Mud Slingers 2.2;<br />Beadlock Wheels - Militants Wheels 2.2;<br />Transmission - Axial Wraith;<br />Motor&amp;ESC combo - Novak Goat 3S Crawler Brushless System 21.5T;<br />Radio System - Futaba 4PL 4-Channel 2.4GHz S-FHSS<br />Bat - Turnigy 2s LiPo 6000 mah<br />Pin - 20<br /><br />The world's largest YouTube channel about rc cars in the mud!
