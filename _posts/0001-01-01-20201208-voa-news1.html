VOA news for Tuesday, December 8th, 2020<br />Via remote, This is VOA news.<br />I'm Michael Brown. Britain health authorities began rolling out the first doses of the widely-tested and independently reviewed COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, starting a global immunization program that is expected to gain momentum as more serums win approval. A 90-year-old woman received the first of two doses of the vaccine jointly developed by a US-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany's BioNtech on Tuesday. Canada announced Monday he received its first doses of the same vaccine by the end of December. The Trump administration turned down the chance last summer to buy millions of additional doses of one of the leading Coronavirus vaccine contenders. That decision could delay the delivery of a second batch of doses until manufacturer Pfizer fulfills other international contracts. The revelation comes a day before President Trump aimed to take credit for the speedy development of forthcoming Coronavirus vaccines at a White House Summit being held later today. Pfizer's vaccine is expected to be endorsed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration advisors as soon as this week. US President-elect Joe Biden has reportedly chosen retired general Lloyd Austin to become a secretary Defense Secretary, that's according to a person familiar with the decision.

The news was first reported by Politico. For details and much more news, we invite you to join us at our website that is VOAnews.com or the VOA mobile app.<br />Via remote, This is VOA news.

The US House of Representatives voted Monday to welcome Hong Kong residents to live temporarily here in the US, vowing to be a beacon for rights as China clamps-down in the territory. The House moved by consensus to issue a so-called temporary protective status for five years to Hong Kong residents, meaning that people from the financial hub will have the right to work here in the United States and will not be subject to deportation.
