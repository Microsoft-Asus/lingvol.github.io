My goal is to focus on the real-world aspects of business, giving practical tips and tricks that are not usually covered in school.<br /><br />This channel is a platform to help entrepreneurs and business owners succeed.  It is also to help the world at large to be more effective and successful.  The world can certainly use more inspiring leaders, more successful entrepreneurs, and more capable managers - that is what I would like to help bring about.<br /><br />Who Am I?<br />I am a practicing management consultant, former CEO, and entrepreneur.  I have led many businesses to success, as well as several startups.<br /><br />I have worked across five industries, and have worked in both large enterprise and small businesses.  In the last five years, I have also been mentoring startup founders and teaching business at a post-graduate level.<br /><br />Why I Want To Involve My Community:<br />The only way this channel will succeed is with YOUR help.  In order to know how best to proceed, I need constant feedback from YOU.  What topics should I cover?  What challenges are you facing?  What questions do you have?  What changes should I make?<br /><br />Please contact me with questions, and I will try my best to help.  Best of luck!<br /><br />Why I Need Your Help:<br />It is also very important to me that this channel be financially independent, and not be sustained by corporate sponsors.  That way, I can be objective and honest, without having to serve interested parties, or disguise promotions as “advice”.  My professional reputation is very important to me.  I will invest the money raised back into the video making process.  Your support will allow me to continue producing videos on a regular basis, and with increasing quality and usefulness.<br /><br />Thank you for being here and reading this, and have yourself an amazing day!<br /><br />-Bill<br />#business #businessadvice #mentoring<br /><br />Welcome to The Companies Expert Channel for Business Success!<br />This is my channel trailer.  <br /><br />This channel is for business education, innovation, business success story, expert business, best business channel on youtube, MBA business management, expert channel, small business expert success stories, and tips from successful entrepreneurs in Winnipeg Canada.
