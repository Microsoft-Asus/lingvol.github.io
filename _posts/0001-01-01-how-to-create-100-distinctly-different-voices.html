Despite it being an oversaturated industry already, it's also full of extremely talented and dynamic speakers which makes the competition fiercely high when trying to get into this field. <br />That said, most people are only able to speak in their own voice, accent and language. Very few can make careers using multiple voices...but the ones that do make an absolute killing. <br /><br />This is why it's really worth investing the time into learning how to nurture this skill properly so that you can stand out and create dynamic, eclectic but most importantly  believable characters. <br /><br />This video aims to help you achieve this by offering a checklist of characteristics to think about when developing your character's voice. <br /><br />Are you ready?<br /><br />THE CHARACTER VOICE CHECKLIST:<br />Things to consider when developing a new voice type -<br /><br />LABAN EFFORTS<br />Dabbing<br />Flicking<br />Pressing<br />Thrusting<br />Gliding<br />Floating<br />Wringing<br />Slashing<br /><br />AIR PLACEMENT<br />Nasally<br />Throaty<br />Mixed (regular)<br /><br />AIR TEXTURE<br />Breathy<br />Dry<br /><br />AGE RANGE<br />Young<br />Middle aged<br />Old<br /><br />GENDER<br />Male<br />Female<br /><br />SIZE<br />Small<br />Medium<br />Large<br /><br />TEMPO<br />Slow<br />Medium<br />Fast<br /><br />VOLUME<br />Quiet<br />Mid<br />Loud<br /><br />TONE/ATTITUDE<br />Friendly<br />Impartial<br />Agressive<br /><br />ACCENTS<br /><br />VOCAL ISSUES<br /><br />Recommended reading - <br />Laban for all: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WsSmQr">https://amzn.to/2WsSmQr</a><br />Freeing the natural voice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WutaJ8">https://amzn.to/2WutaJ8</a><br />The Art Of Breathing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HLqXpG">https://amzn.to/2HLqXpG</a><br /><br />vocabilities.com is a new website designed to help people utilise their voices to maximum effect. <br /><br />We can help you...<br /><br />Gain confidence in presenting yourself with spoken English<br /><br />Become a more authoritative, engaging and resonant voice <br /><br />Work on and develop your speech, sales pitch or presentation<br /><br />Learn physical and practical training techniques for daily practice<br /><br />See an immediate and positive change over the quality of your communication<br /><br />Focus on pitch, tone, projection, articulation, accent and intention<br /><br />Overcome nerves and engage your audience.<br /><br />Relax and find comfort in your physicality, body language, speech delivery and conversational grammar. ​
