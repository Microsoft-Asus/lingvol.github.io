Lacey claims Krystal has threatened to kill her multiple times, burn her parents’ house down, drinks too much, and is unstable. Krystal says she’s on a healing journey and getting her life together. Their mom, Eileen, admits she has spent over $100,000 to support Krystal and says she has no plans to stop.<br /><br />Dr. Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people. The Dr. Phil show provides the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television. For over a decade, Dr. McGraw has used the show's platform to make psychology accessible and understandable to the general public by addressing important personal and social issues. Using his top-rated show as a teaching tool, he takes aim at the critical issues of our time, including the &quot;silent epidemics&quot; of bullying, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, child abuse, suicide, and various forms of severe mental illness.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drphil.com">https://www.drphil.com</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bitly.com/DrPhilFacebook">http://bitly.com/DrPhilFacebook</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bitly.com/DrPhilTwitter">http://bitly.com/DrPhilTwitter</a>{% endraw %}
