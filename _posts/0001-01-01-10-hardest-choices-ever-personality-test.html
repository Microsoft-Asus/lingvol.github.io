How to make the right choice? Here are 10 extremely difficult choices you will ever have to make! Throughout our lives, we are constantly bombarded with major choices. Our decisions determine your future and define you and shape your personality. In this video, Bright Side offers you to make 10 extremely difficult choices. At the end of the video, we’ll tell what kind of person you are! <br /><br />TEST RULES<br />There are only two possible answers to each question. You need to choose between option A and option B. As you’re taking the test, keep track of how many times you chose A or B because you’ll need these totals at the end of the video to find out your results. You’ll only have 5 seconds to think about each question before we give the explanation. Don’t think too long, and go with your gut; you’ll get the most accurate results that way!<br /><br />WOULD YOU RATHER...<br />...be the smartest person or the most charming? 1:17<br />...you rather always have to tell the truth or lie? 1:47<br />...never have Internet or never take an airplane? 2:21<br />...find true love or win a million dollars? 3:04<br />...never be able to speak or have to say everything on your mind? 3:28<br />...have a photographic memory or be able to forget anything you want? 4:09<br />...never have sex again or never eat your favorite food? 4:50<br />...be the only person to live a happy life or be the only person to live an unhappy life? 5:19<br />...be the first person to discover an inhabitable planet or inventor of a drug that cures a deadly disease? 5:58<br />...be poor but able to help people or get incredibly rich by hurting other people? 6:38<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />If you chose A 1 to 3 times, you’re a pretty selfish person. Very few people would like to work with you on a team. It’s not that bad though; it just means that you prefer fighting for yourself to get exactly what you want. <br /><br />If you chose option A 4 to 6 times, it means that you’re moderately selfish. You’re like the Goldilocks of this list: not too much, not too little, just right. Pretty much most people would fall into this category. You can be selfish when you need to be.<br /><br />If you chose option A 7 to 10 times, you’re the type of person who is always ready to sacrifice your own interests for someone else. <br /><br />What results did you get?
