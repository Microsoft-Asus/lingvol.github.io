To support my efforts to create more clips please donate to me at www.patreon.com/allinaday. I am very proud of the TV series I made for PBS called Making Sense of the Sixties. I had the chance to spend a year examining my youth and how I became an active member of the 60s generation. If you are from that generation or a child of the 60s, I think you would find the entire series of value. To see my other work visit www.theHoffmancollection.com.<br />A quote from Hesiod, 8th Century BC â€œI see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on frivolous youth of today, for certainly all youth are reckless beyond words. When I was young, we were taught to be discreet and respectful of elders, but the present youth are exceedingly disrespectful and impatient of restraint&quot;<br />#hippie #1960s @countercutlure
