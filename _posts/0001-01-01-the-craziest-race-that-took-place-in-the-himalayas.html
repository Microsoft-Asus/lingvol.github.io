{% raw %}Adventure Racing World Series - Expedition India 2019<br /><br />In March 2019, we got to be a part of the film crew shooting the first ever Adventure Racing World Series event in the country - Expedition India 2019. It was a 450KM non-stop race from Manali to Shimla, with over 20 teams participating from all around the world. The course was divided into different legs - hiking, cycling, rafting - to cover the entire distance. <br /><br />We got to work with an amazing film crew from South Africa - Elevated Adventure Films - and had a blast shooting with them! :)<br /><br />Race Organisers: Kinetic Events, South Africa<br /><br />A film by: Ronnie &amp; Barty<br />Drone Footage: Elevated Adventure Films, South Africa <br />Original Score: Rohan Thakur<br /><br />Our killer new DRONE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Lmu8TQ">https://amzn.to/2Lmu8TQ</a><br />Our MAIN CAMERA - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZCjwFB">https://amzn.to/2ZCjwFB</a><br />Handy GORILLAPOD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NEiRBe">https://amzn.to/2NEiRBe</a><br />The MIC we use - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34b9a35">https://amzn.to/34b9a35</a><br /><br />For more details about our EQUIPMENT check out our Amazon Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/shop/ronnie_and_barty">https://www.amazon.in/shop/ronnie_and_barty</a>{% endraw %}
