{% raw %}Along with &quot;America's Train&quot; NRFF, Reading and Northern's other Fast Freight, the WHFF is another fairly timetabled run. Operating Sunday through Friday, the WHFF (WHFF2 south, WHFF1 north) begins in the busy Humboldt Industrial Park outside of Hazelton, PA, operating south on former LV/CNJ rails to Haucks, and the ex RDG to North Reading, with work at Hazelton and Port Clinton on the way. Usually on duty around 1700-1730, the train is best chased during the longer days of the year, and thanks to a 3 mile shove outta the park to the Hazelton Line, the train warrants a caboose. This video features a bunch of catches of the West Hazelton Fast Freight from Spring through to the end of Summer at various locations with various power, including the usual SD40-2s, SD50s and even an SD38. Video, train and location info is in the titles, and enjoy the video!!<br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
