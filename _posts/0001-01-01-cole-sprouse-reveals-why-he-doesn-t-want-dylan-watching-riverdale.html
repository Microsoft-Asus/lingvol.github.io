Cole is back in front of the camera as Jughead Jones on The CW critically acclaimed hit drama, Riverdale… and Dylan? He’s in meadery. I may or may not have had to look that up this morning. But the point is, they live two very different lives. <br /><br />Cole recently opened up to Elle Magazine to dish about his brother’s support, despite their very different lifestyles. <br /><br />&quot;He supports the show. I don't know if he enjoys it. This kind of programming has never really been our flavor of choice. I don't really want him to watch anything I do and I don't really watch anything he'll do.&quot;<br /><br /><br />But even though Dylan may not actually enjoy Riverdale, that possibility would never affect their brotherly love. Cole told the mag QUOTE: <br />&quot;We have a very easy time separating work and play and I wouldn't really care less if he watched or if he enjoyed [Riverdale].&quot; <br /><br /><br />Something tells us, that maybe just maybe, Dylan's enjoying Riverdale just as much as we are, but it's awesome to know that these bros are still as tight as we always dreamed. <br /><br /><br />Cole also dished on getting back into acting, something he didn't necessarily plan on doing anything after college. <br /><br /><br />&quot;As long as it stays fulfilling, I will continue doing it, but the second it stops being fulfilling I'll leave.&quot;<br /><br /><br />You gotta love Cole Sprouse simply keeping it real. <br /><br />For now, we'll just gush over Cole &amp; the rest of his Riverdale crew hanging at Coachella. <br />Now it's time for you to let us know what you think of Cole's interview.
