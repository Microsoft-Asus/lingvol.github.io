Many of the prophecies foretold in orthodox religions have come to pass, as have the predictions made by Nostradamus and those passed down in cultures around the world, from Peru to Korea. In Chinese history, from the Han to the Ming dynasties, there have been surprisingly accurate prophetic texts.<br /><br />These prophecies show us the important truth that history is not a coincidental process, but rather a drama in which the sequence of major events has been pre-established. In the end times, which also could herald the beginning of a new historical cycle, all of the world‚Äôs religions are awaiting one thing: the arrival of the Creator in the human realm.<br /><br />All dramas have a climax. Though the devil has made arrangements to destroy humankind, the Creator has means of awakening the world‚Äôs people, helping them to escape the devil‚Äôs bondage, and offering them salvation. The ultimate battle between good and evil is unfolding today.<br /><br />Orthodox religions the world over have foretold that in the era of the Creator‚Äôs return, the world would be awash with demons, abominations, and ominous events as humanity lost its moral restraints. This is the world today.<br /><br />The state of degeneration we face today has been long in the making. It began hundreds of years ago, with the rise of its core driving forces: atheism and the deception of humanity. It was Karl Marx who created an ideology to encompass the deception in all its permutations, and it was Vladimir Lenin who put the theory into brutal practice.<br /><br />Marx, however, was not an atheist. He was a Satanist and became the demon whose mission it was to prevent man from recognizing the Creator in the end times.<br /><br />#SpecterOfCommunistm #NineCommentaries #Documentary<br /><br />Read more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ntd.com/how-the-specter-of-communism-is-ruling-our-world">https://www.ntd.com/how-the-specter-of-communism-is-ruling-our-world</a><br /><br />To buy the book &quot;How the Specter of Communism is Ruling Our World,&quot; go to<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://epochshop.com/">https://epochshop.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://epochshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/new-how-the-specter-of-communism-is-ruling-our-world-3-books-shipping-after-july-1">https://epochshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/new-how-the-specter-of-communism-is-ruling-our-world-3-books-shipping-after-july-1</a><br /><br />üíéSign the petition to investigate, condemn, and reject the Chinese Communist Party<br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rejectccp.com">https://rejectccp.com</a><br />üíéSubscribe to NTD:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ept.ms/NTD">https://ept.ms/NTD</a><br />üíéSupport NTD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ntd.com/support-us.html">https://www.ntd.com/support-us.html</a><br /><br />For more news and videos visit ‚òõ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ntd.com">http://ntd.com</a><br />Follow us on Twitter ‚òõ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/news_ntd">https://twitter.com/news_ntd</a><br />Add us on Facebook ‚òõ<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NTDTelevision/">https://www.facebook.com/NTDTelevision/</a>
