US Studies CEO Simon Jackman says the vote in Georgia will be so close it will likely end up in “recount territory”. <br /><br />The current vote count in Georgia has a margin of 1700 votes in favour of Donald Trump. <br /><br />With a further 10,000 to 12,000 votes to go, the count could well swing either way. <br /><br /> “We’re certainly in recount territory perhaps,” Mr Jackman said. <br /><br />“The issue is, when is a recount a recount, and when is a recount a recanvas and a re-examination of the validity of canvas.”<br /><br />Mr Jackman explained a usual recount involved running the stack of ballots through a machine to ensure the votes were calculated correctly.<br /><br />“It’s quite technical,” he said. <br /><br />“If a recount though means we are now open to checking the validity of so many of these ballots, we’re going to look to see if every 'i' was dotted, that’s where you end up in court.”
