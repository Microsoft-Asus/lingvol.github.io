{% raw %}This a virtual tour from around Providence Rhode Island in Fall 2019. Providence has a Water fire walk at night along the water front, which is popular during the summer. In the video I walk around downtown Providence then go over to Federal Hill and explore Little Italy and Atwater Street. I also walk around East Providence a bit where Brown University is located.<br /><br />Island Hopper TV is a travel resource for adventure seekers looking to discover many destinations across the planet. Having been encouraged to explore the world outside of the United States I have traveled many places solo and through Island Hopper TV I share the experience.<br /><br />#Providence #Rhodeisland<br /><br />Watch our Full USA Vlog Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/UnitedStates">https://geni.us/UnitedStates</a>{% endraw %}
