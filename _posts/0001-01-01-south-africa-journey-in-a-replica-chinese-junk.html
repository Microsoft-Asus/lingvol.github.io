English/Nat<br /><br />Keyword-WACKY   <br /><br />A trip across oceans on an old boat was just what the doctor ordered for former French aid worker Michael Pitiot. <br /><br /><br /><br />Stationed in Vietnam he decided to make his way back to his native France in a replica of an ancient Chinese junk.<br /><br /><br /><br />Michael Pitiot and his crew of four set sail from Saigon about eight months ago. <br /><br /><br /><br />Their boat is the Sao Mai, or, in English, &quot;The Morning Star&quot;, the replica of an old Chinese junk. <br /><br /><br /><br />They stopped over in Cape Town, South Africa, to rest and to stock up on supplies before continuing their voyage to Europe.<br /><br /><br /><br />The journey is leisurely, the Sao Mai covers only four nautical miles a day. <br /><br /><br /><br />It will travel up the west coast of Africa, taking in St Helena Island and the Azores before arriving in Brest, France. <br /><br /><br /><br />They hope to reach their destination in mid-July in time for one of the biggest boat<br /><br />shows in the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />Four thousand vessels are expected at the show.<br /><br /><br /><br />SOUNDBITE: (English)<br /><br />&quot;There will be in France one of the biggest traditional boat show in the world. They are waiting for nearly 4,000 boats coming from all over the world and for more than, I don't know,  maybe five or six million visitors. And we are the only boat coming from Asia so that's another problem. We have to be there on time.&quot;<br /><br />SUPER CAPTION: Michael Pitiot, Sao Mai Captain<br /><br /><br /><br />The crew stocked up with tinned food, fresh vegetables and fresh drinking water. <br /><br /><br /><br />They also hope to supplement their diet by catching fish along the way. <br /><br /><br /><br />Pitiot is an experienced sailor, but the other guys are all new to the game.<br /><br /><br /><br />They plan to while away their leisure time playing musical instruments such as the African Djembe drums, read books on photography and classical novels.<br /><br /><br /><br />The only electronic gear on the Sao Mai is the radio and the global positioning system (G-P-S).  <br /><br /><br /><br />Everything else on the boat is gas powered.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You can license this story through AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/695b59403bd68934d972391cbe1d4917">http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/695b59403bd68934d972391cbe1d4917</a> <br /><br />Find out more about AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork">http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork</a>
