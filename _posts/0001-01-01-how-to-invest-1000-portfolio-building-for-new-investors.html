It's a secret that money managers don't want you to know about.  Here it is:<br /><br />You can own/trade individual stocks, #etf's, own #index funds and limited partnerships or bond funds all within your roth ira account!  The secret is in the type of account you need to start.  The self directed account. <br /><br />You will not hear this from your financial planner.  This relatively new service is available to anyone who opts to take charge of their own financial future and can do so by starting a self-managed Roth IRA.  Any roth account will provide tax shelter and allow for contributions and earnings to be withdrawn at age 59.5 years old.  However, only a self-managed account can maximize profits through wealth preservation by eliminating fees charged to traditional investment accounts.  Cumulative growth, dividend re-investment and compounding interest can all work to maximum potential for you free of the damaging effect of fees from traditional managed account types.<br /><br />It's an exciting time to be an independent investor.  Accelerate your returns by building a passive or active portfolio using my 22 years of experience and foundational approaches that are easy to understand and take little to no experience.  Just a little initiative will result in stepping into a whole new world of accelerated profits and financial security for you, and your family.<br /><br />No too accounts are the same.  Investment tolerances differ.  That makes it even more important for you to pay attention to and learn some of the basic terminology, potentials, account types and use them to align your specific financial plan with your financial future.<br /><br />See what it's like to become an Independent Investor.  It may be the most financially liberating move you could ever make in your life!
