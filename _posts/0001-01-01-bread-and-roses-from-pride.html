There is one specific couplet from this poem that for me demonstrates a writer's ability to take the same words we all know and use and yet arrange them in a way that seem as profound as secrets God would would whisper to the stars lol  But the full work is right below the lines I pulled from it.<br /><br />'Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes--<br />Hearts starve as well as bodies: Give us Bread, but give us Roses!'<br /><br />&quot;Bread and Roses&quot;<br />James Oppenheim<br />Published: The Cry For Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest, ed. by Upton Sinclair, John C. Winston Co., 1915.<br /><br />As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of the day,<br />A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill-lofts gray <br />Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,<br />For the people hear us singing, &quot;Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses.&quot;<br />As we come marching, marching, we battle, too, for men--<br />For they are women's children and we mother them again. <br />Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes--<br />Hearts starve as well as bodies: Give us Bread, but give us Roses!<br />As we come marching, marching, unnumbered women dead<br />Go crying through our singing their ancient song of Bread;<br />Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew--<br />Yes, bread we fight for--but we fight for Roses, too.<br />As we come marching, marching, we bring the Greater Days--<br />The rising of the women means the rising of the race--<br />No more the drudge and idler--ten that toil where one reposes--<br />But sharing of life's glories: Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses!
