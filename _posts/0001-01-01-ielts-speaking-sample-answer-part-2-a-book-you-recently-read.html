ðŸ˜ƒMy online course - DISCOUNTED! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ielts-speaking-success-get-a-band-7/?couponCode=AC94BAND7YOUNOV3">https://www.udemy.com/course/ielts-speaking-success-get-a-band-7/?couponCode=AC94BAND7YOUNOV3</a><br /><br /><br />This is a sample answer to an IELTS Speaking Part 2 Question - Describe a book you recently read<br /><br />CUE CARD<br /><br />Describe a book you recently read<br /><br />You should say,<br /><br />What it was<br />What it is about<br />Why you read it<br /><br />and explain how you felt about it.<br /><br />Transcript <br /><br />Iâ€™d like to tell you about a book called â€˜Slice of the Moonâ€™,<br /><br />itâ€™s by Sonia Toksvig, at least, I think thatâ€™s the authorâ€™s name.<br /><br />So, my sister gave this book to my daughter and then I borrowed it from my daughter <br /><br />erm, partly because my sister had said she had read it and couldnâ€™t put it down.<br /><br /><br />Well, itâ€™s set in rural Ireland in the 19th century<br /><br />and itâ€™s the story of how a family fled the country to escape the famine. <br /><br />It then narrates their journey across the sea to America <br /><br />It's told from the point of view of the young girl in the family <br /><br />and it's a really captivating book, but quite horrific, I mean it sent shivers down my spine.<br /><br />Many of the characters die on the trip. <br /><br />It was very tragic, one sad event after another. <br /><br />I liked the way the author developed the plot and built these characters that you feel so much for, <br /><br />especially the young girl who is adorable.  <br /><br />I think I really enjoyed it because it is a doddle to read <br /><br />I know itâ€™s aimed at young children or teenagers <br /><br />but it is really engaging, I mean, the cliff-hangers had me on the edge of my seat <br /><br />all the way through.<br /><br /><br /><br />OverallI I would definitely recommend it, I think it's a really good read, <br /><br />both for children and adults <br /><br />I think thereâ€™s something for everybody there <br /><br />So itâ€™s great, in fact, Iâ€™d go as far as to say <br /><br />itâ€™s possibly the best adventure book for children that I have ever read.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />FREE e-book: AVOID 10 MOST COMMON MISTAKES IN IELTS SPEAKING:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://keithspeakingacademy.com">https://keithspeakingacademy.com</a><br /><br /><br />Follow me on social media<br /><br />Facebook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/KeithIELTSMastermind/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/KeithIELTSMastermind/</a> <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/keith_speaking_academy/">https://www.instagram.com/keith_speaking_academy/</a><br /><br />Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://keithspeakingacademy.com/">https://keithspeakingacademy.com/</a>
