Introduction to mechanical ventilation for house officers rotating in the Intensive Care Unit.   Basics of fully supported modes (Assist/Control, PRVC) and weaning modes (CPAP, PS, T-tube trial).<br /><br />These are my opinions.  They are not official statements of either Maimonides Medical Center or Albert Einstein College of Medicine.<br />They are not medical advice.
