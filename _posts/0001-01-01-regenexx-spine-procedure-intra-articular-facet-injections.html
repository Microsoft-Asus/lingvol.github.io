How Regenexx procedures are very different and far more advanced than typical spine injection procedures. Dr. Jason Markle of the Centeno Schultz Clinic in Broomfield, CO guides you through a Regenexx Intra-Articular Fact Joint Injection. Regenexx Network Providers can be found across the United States and at International locations.
