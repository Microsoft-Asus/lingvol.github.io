Allow yourself to be immersed in Aurai once again and see what’s coming in the new, hard hitting DLC for OUTWARD, “The Soroboreans”.<br /><br />Filled to the brim with new content that will add a breath of fresh air to your game, “The Soroboreans” DLC will get you worried about a lot more than starving to death, dehydration, losing your backpack and… well everything else!<br /><br />From New Skills, Enchantments, New weapon type (The Gauntlets) to terrifying Dungeons and blood thirsty creatures, you’re going to be busy for a while in the world of Aurai!<br />Outward is an open-world fantasy role-playing game developed by Canadian studio Nine Dots and published by Deep Silver. The game can be played in multiplayer both online and or locally (through splitscreen). The game focuses on survival as well as the concept of the player being a commoner rather than a hero, and features several survival game aspects.<br /><br />Outward includes several survival aspects, such as having to carefully watch one's warmth, hunger, fatigue and thirst. It's also possible for the player character to suffer from such conditions as a cold, a disease or indigestion. Losing all of one's health in battle can lead to a variety of consequences, including being imprisoned by enemies or being brought back to safety by an NPC. The game has an auto-save system, meaning the player is unable to manually save and return to earlier saves upon death or other such setbacks. While the game has a magic system, spells were specifically designed to be challenging to obtain. Similarly, skills and stat increases must all be earned by completing quests for NPCs or paying experts to receive training.<br /><br />Celtic Impulse - Celtic by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100297">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100297</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>
