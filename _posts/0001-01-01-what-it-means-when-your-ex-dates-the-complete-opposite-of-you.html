{% raw %}Even after you call it quits, it can be weird when your ex dates someone exactly like you.<br /><br />It’s even more confusing when your ex’s new boo is the complete opposite of you.<br /><br />Is this the kind of person your partner wanted to be with the whole time?<br /><br />Bring on the self-doubt and self-criticism.<br /><br />And that’s the problem.<br /><br />Take it from a psychotherapist Bustle spoke with.<br /><br />She says all of this worrying can give you an answer, even if it’s the wrong one.<br /><br />Your ex is most likely dating your opposite for a simple reason; it’s a reflection of who they are now – not who you were then.<br /><br />Meaning, a bunch of factors influence attraction like the stage of life they’re at when they meet someone.<br /><br />They might not have a type at all, so don’t sweat it.<br /><br />If you need answers, try and have the closure talk with your ex about their new flame and how they’re different than you.<br /><br />If that’s not going to fly, all you need to know is that your ex’s new partner has nothing to do with you or what you had together.<br /><br />It can be totally random.<br /><br />A therapeutic relationship coach tells Bustle the new relationship is just a way for your ex to discover a new side of themselves.<br /><br />There is some truth to the old saying, “opposites attract.”<br /><br />That goes for you, too.<br /><br />If you spend time stalking their new flame, do the opposite!<br /><br />Block your ex on social media and focus on what makes you unique.<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/buzz60">http://www.youtube.com/buzz60</a><br /><br />Buzz60 is designed for the way we live now.
