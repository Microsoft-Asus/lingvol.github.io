Here are the important factors to consider when you're looking to buy a computer as a developer.<br /><br />Custom-Build vs Prebuilt PC<br />With a custom computer, you must decide what kind of hardware to get. It would require much more knowledge. Since you are buying every single component separately, you need to make sure that they are compatible with each other.<br /><br />With a prebuilt computer, it is much more convenient but you will be limited by the hardware installed by the seller. You may still be able to upgrade or replace parts, but you will only have whatever opportunities the computer seller gives to you.<br /><br />Custom PCs used to be a cheaper choice. But what we have seen recently, the mobile industry started using a lot more RAM in production, which has resulted in a shortage of RAM shortage in the industry. And in the past recent years, GPU prices became so expensive because people were going crazy about cryptocurrency mining.<br /><br />So in reality, buying a pre-built computer may be a cheaper option since the parts are bought directly in bundles from the manufacturers.<br /><br />Desktop Computer VS Laptop<br />The primary factor here would be portability. If you travel a lot or need your workstation to be with you at all times, then a laptop is the right choice.<br /><br />Today, laptops are powerful enough that they can be used for web development and coding. Many professional web developers have admitted that they haven’t used a desktop in years as laptops offer the flexibility to conduct their work from anywhere.<br /><br />What laptops lack is the upgradeability. You can’t alter major things in laptops. So you’ll have to carefully choose what model is the right one for you.<br /><br />The screen is crucial on a laptop. Due to size constraints, laptop displays are comparatively very small. So you should pick a laptop with a screen that is large and crisp enough for your tasks.<br /><br />When picking up the storage device, choosing a laptop with SSD is better in terms of performance. But it is more expensive compared to the traditional hard disk drives.<br /><br /><br />The battery is another crucial factor for a laptop. You should look for a battery with the longest runtime. Generally, you should pick a laptop with a battery that has the most electrical charge.<br /><br /><br />--<br />The 3 most commonly used operating systems nowadays are Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.<br /><br />Windows is the most popular system. Windows supports most programming languages, so if the programming language of your choice works on Windows, you may look no further.<br /><br />Mac OS is a very popular choice among web developers nowadays. If you're an iOS app developer, Mac OS is definitely a good choice.<br /><br />Linux is far ahead of Mac and Windows when it comes to security and customizability. But it may lack in tools and software when compared to the other two operating systems.<br /><br />Which Operating System should you choose?<br />As a programmer, you might often find yourself in a situation where you have to switch over to another operating system.<br /><br />You probably need to run Linux on Windows PC or run Windows on Mac. In these cases, you need to ensure the machine you are working with has sufficient RAM in order to do these things.<br /><br />When you are using a virtual machine like Parallels or Boot Camp to boot the next Operating System as a virtual machine. You will have the options to go with what includes Linux, Windows, or Mac-dependent on your software requirements.<br /><br /><br />--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sQHjk5XAlc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sQHjk5XAlc</a><br />best computer for coding<br />best computer for programmer<br />best computer for developer<br />best pc for programming<br />laptop or desktop for programming<br />best laptop for programmer<br />best laptop for coder<br />best laptop for coding
