He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.<br /><br />Subscribe To Philosophies for Life<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ</a><br /><br />Music - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ</a>
