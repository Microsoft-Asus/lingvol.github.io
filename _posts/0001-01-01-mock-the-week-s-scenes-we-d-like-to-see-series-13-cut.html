Series 13 had a New Year's Eve special, also ommitted. Also in this, one of the SWLTS spoofs on the idea of punishing soccer players with sprayable white lines and a lackluster 2015 World Cup introduction of the nation of Brazil. This was also Dara's first and only instance in MTW history that he participated in SWLTS.
