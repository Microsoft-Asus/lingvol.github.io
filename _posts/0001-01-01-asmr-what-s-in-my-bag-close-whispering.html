There are heavy hearts across the world at this time, and I hope this video can bring you validation, comfort, a sense of safety, and a space to just be and come as you are. <br /><br />-NOTE: I'm stepping away from comments/ media for a period of time, so please remember I value and respect each and every one of you. Mental health care is VITAL, and encourage each and every one of you to seek help if need be. <br />I'll still be posting, just stepping away for personal healing purposes.<br /><br />***Today’s video includes an up close whisper while showing you the contents of my bag.<br />With tapping, repeating words, hand movements, tracing, whispered affirmations, and words of self love for you all.💕 (Blue Yeti mic)<br /><br />*****🌟🌟Business email: graceasmr58@gmail.com<br />SOCIAL MEDIA⬇️⬇️<br />****🌟INSTAGRAM: graceasmr<br /><br />ASMR has played such a consistent, important role in my life as I continue to take this journey of self love, and healing. I hope I can spark the light for your heart/ mind and to be gentle to your being. This is OUR journey. Tingle away and remember you're worthy of all!💕💕
