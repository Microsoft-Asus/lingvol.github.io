Well this is my first day at work and ill say it was fairly awesome. Started out doing some simple tasks like house keeping and adding Calking between the roof and the walls. <br /><br />   Im glad that my new job started me out with fairly simple tasks. Being and office rat in my previous job really put me out of shape.  I was a bit afraid that I wouldn't be able to make it in construction. Even though it wasn't that hard to begin with I did have a bit of pain after. Any whoo, this vid is a week old so ill be trying to up load as soon as I can. Been a big preoccupy braking in the new job.
