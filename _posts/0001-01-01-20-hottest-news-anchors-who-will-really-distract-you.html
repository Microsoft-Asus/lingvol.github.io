They have to look visually appealing, but that doesn’t always mean that they have to be good looking. If a person can look confident on camera and be really good at digging up the facts, they can get a gig as an anchor. Yet, there are special news anchors out there who can help drive up a news station’s ratings just by gracing our TVs with their presence. Female news anchors are especially good at boosting ratings. Sure, there are male news anchors that can attract viewers too, but women are typically seen as a more valuable asset. Those who find these women attractive usually find it easier to retain the information that's presented to them. In essence, they pay more attention. Huge surprise, right? Well, the media has gotten wind of this amazing formula, and there are thousands of news stations that use certain anchors to boost their ratings.<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRichest.org">https://www.facebook.com/TheRichest.org</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheRichest_Com">https://twitter.com/TheRichest_Com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/therichest">http://instagram.com/therichest</a><br /> <br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.therichest.com/">http://www.therichest.com/</a>
