In this inspiring talk, Scott Pierce shows us that “Yes, and” is not just the first rule of improv, but it also touches on deeper lessons that we can apply to our everyday lives.  Scott Pierce is a born technologist, writing his first production code for his parents’ software company at 10 years old. Pierce worked as a software developer for a variety of companies before taking a technology leadership position at of one of the South’s largest ad agencies.<br /><br />In his spare time, Pierce can be found working a stage as a trained improvisational actor. He likes to read, cook, and play with his cats, but he never combines cooking with his cats. He has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, and by his own assessment, he is a mediocre musician at saxophone, guitar, and piano. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
