Speeches by Carl-Henrik Heldin, Chairman of the Nobel Foundation, and by members of the prize-awarding institutions will be interwoven with the ceremonial presentations in the Laureates’ home countries. H.M. the King of Sweden will participate in the form of a digital greeting. The ceremony will be framed by musical interludes.
