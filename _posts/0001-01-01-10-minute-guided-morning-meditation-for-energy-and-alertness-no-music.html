Waking up and feeling groggy, tired, and sleepy? Here’s a short 10 minute guided meditation for the morning to give you a boost of energy and bring on a sense of alertness. <br /><br />We’ll start the mindfulness meditation practice by bringing in the morning sun and invigorating ourselves with some natural and positive energy from natural light. We’ll then use some simple breathing exercises to get us more alert, before continuing the practice with some affirmations, and continuing on to the rest of our productive day.<br /><br />#guidedmeditation #energy #morning<br /><br />This guided meditation practice is from our app, Declutter The Mind.
