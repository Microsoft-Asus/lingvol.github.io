How to Deal with Change | A Monk's Guide to Impermanence<br /><br />So much is going on in the world. We are impacted by COVID-19, elections, politics, personal relationships, finances, etc. Things are constantly moving and shifting on a daily basis. So how do we cope with it all? Today, I wanted to take this time to talk about impermanence. Impermanence is the concept that things are constantly changing. When understood, this truth  that the Buddha taught can help to guide us in our daily lives and times of change. For Buddhist monks, we continue to do our daily practice of meditation to help us cope with impermanence. During this difficult time, I hope this video can be of some help to you. <br />#covid-19 #monks #dealingwithchange<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />2:17 Impermanence<br />3:31 Attaching to Good<br />6:36 Attaching to Bad<br />9:27 What's next?<br />10:28 How to apply wisdom<br /><br />*********************************************<br />FREE downloads below:<br /> <br />FREE Meditation Guide: 21-Day Habit Formation:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/gaIRRX">http://eepurl.com/gaIRRX</a><br /><br />How to Become a Monk FREE Guide:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/dO6T1r">http://eepurl.com/dO6T1r</a><br /><br />FREE Self-Care Checklist: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/dPbHxz">http://eepurl.com/dPbHxz</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching.
