An opportunity to improve wellness, prevention, quality of life and overall health<br /><br />Healthcare is chronically ill and the major symptom is escalating costs.  Reactive health care cannot address the common chronic health problems that are predictable via lifestyles, habits and common situations challenging individuals and caregivers.  The major players of healthcare: consumers, health providers and payors (i.e. insurances and government) do not share values or goals.  Poor oral health is the most prevalent chronic health concern and is impacted by threats transparent to overall health and wellness.  Beginning at birth, health promotion can be easily facilitated through oral health literacy.  A password-protected, consumer-centered, and transparent healthcare interface tracking oral health assessment and dental examination outcomes data can provide consumer autonomy and confidence and healthcare a method for global health guidance and reduction of costs for care management.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
