“Where do I go to find the meaning of existence and the meaning of life? For me, that’s Christianity.” —Martin Scorsese, writer and director<br /><br />Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese discusses faith, suffering, and more after a screening of his new film “Silence,” the powerful story of Jesuit missionaries in 17th-century Japan. Scorsese reflected on the film and on Christian faith with Fuller Seminary’s Kutter Callaway, assistant professor of theology and culture, and Mako Fujimura, director of the Brehm Center.<br /><br />The screening was sponsored by Reel Spirituality, an initiative of the Brehm Center for Worship, Theology, and the Arts.
