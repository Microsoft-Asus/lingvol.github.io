Holland's best Aircraft Spotting Site has been closed permamently last saturday januari 26..!Watch the video,and by the way:<br /><br />due sircumstances y did confused the Airbus 321-231 with a B-767...SORRY about that!  If i would correct that in the video itself, i will loose ALL thouse thousands of hits,and ofcourse i do not like...<br /><br /><br /><br />Look-out for my other clip about the &quot;New Aircraft Spotting Site&quot; alongside Amsterdam runway 18R / 36L (Polderbaan)
