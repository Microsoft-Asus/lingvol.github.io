{% raw %}By August the leaves of Taro (Gahala/Kiri ala) turns into a yellowish color. They say this is the best time to harvest this root yam. Though this root yam is known as “Gahala” (green taro), traditionally they are being called as “Kiri Ala” in Sri Lanka. “Taro” is a very nourishing as well as a delicious indigenous root yam! This yam is being enjoyed by our traditional Sri Lankan’s by boiling them and eaten with a “lunu miris” (very famous spicy Sri Lankan chilli sambol) for their breakfast. But since we have this very spicy mutton curry for lunch I thought to give this traditional yam a twist by making a white curry out of them.<br /><br />To the mutton curry I used our best and natural high quality Sri Lanka spices which I make each of these spice and curry powder at home as per our family traditional methods. Finally added few fresh red chilies to give the curry that hot kick. My mutton curry’s flavor and the richness got enhanced with all these home made curry powder. Since the mutton curry is &quot;Fire hot and spicy&quot;, I cooked the Taro curry with lots of coconut milk to subtle the heat of the mutton curry. Grand mother makes a very tasty tempered dish(devilled dish) out of the stems of the Taro tree.  I have never tasted such mouthwatering tempered dish that grandmother used to make. Do you know my friends, that it’s not very easy to make this tempered dish as one wrong move, this dish will make your mouth itch. The taste becomes unforgettable when a handful of dried prawns are added to this yum tempered dish! I was very satisfied as the lunch table was laid with simple, very nutritious and delicious dishes which were made with a very minimum time as well.<br /><br />Oh...! I forgot to tell you about this unusual golden delicious goodness that we got for dessert from my elder aunty’s garden. This is a new version of the normal watermelon but the color is golden yellow instead of the normal ruby red. It’s a new variety it seems, grown from some seeds where the agriculture officer had given to my aunty. The yellow watermelon is almost similar to the usual red watermelon but the taste is almost so sweet as bees honey. Of course I’m sure you must have noticed how our dear brother ate each piece, holding from both his hands also by his mouth!!<br /><br />Love you All!<br />Nadee<br /><br />——————————————————<br />Ingredient Subtitles<br /><br />Please turn on CC (Subtitles) in your own language to display all the ingredient names on the screen and the dialogues in bigger font.<br /><br /><br />乡村烹饪 cuisine de village गाँव का खाना बनाना cucina del villaggio طبخ القرية Dorfkochen 村の料理 dorp koken 마을 요리 pagluluto ng nayon деревенская кухня cozinha da vila ഗ്രാമീണ പാചകം cocina del pueblo গ্রাম রান্না vesnické vaření landsby madlavning ចម្អិនអាហារតាមភូមិ kylän ruoanlaitto गाउँ खाना पकाउने masakan desa கிராம சமையல் masakan kampung หมู่บ้านทำอาหาร gotowanie na wsi köy pişirme làng nấu ăn ရွာချက်ပြုတ် μαγειρική στο χωριό villa coctione<br /><br />Inspired by 李子柒 Liziqi and Dianxi Xiaoge<br /><br />Watch all my videos(playlist) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz7Dd...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz7Dd...</a><br />Music - Traditional Me © <br />FACEBOOK : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/traditionalme/">https://www.facebook.com/traditionalme/</a><br /><br />#villagecooking #srilankanfood #traditionalme #village #villagelife #villagefood #nadee #countryfood{% endraw %}
