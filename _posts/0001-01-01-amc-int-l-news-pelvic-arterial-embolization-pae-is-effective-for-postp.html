Sometimes, women encounter great danger with unstoppable uterine bleeding after giving birth to a child. These cases, in general, were treated by uterus removal. However, AMC's Professor Ji-hoon Shin's team has proved that uterine bleeding can be treated with a simple surgical procedure.<br /><br />Now we can expect to relieve, so-called 'childbirth fear', the fear of losing life from excessive bleeding or the fear of losing uterus which takes away the opportunity to have more children.<br /><br />In the past, if bleeding was severe during labor, the uterus needed to be removed because it was difficult to find the exact bleeding spot.<br /><br />However, AMC's Professor Ji-hoon Shin's team has successfully performed Pelvic Arterial Embolizations, the PAE, on women who had severe bleeding during labor without removing their uterus.<br /><br />Professor Shin has performed the procedure to a total of 225 patients over the past decade. Among those patients, 86% experienced the ceasing of the bleeding through single procedure, and if we include patients undergone repeated procedure, the success rate reached up to 98%.<br /><br />Professor Shin Ji-hoon / Dept. of Radiology<br /><br />In the past, the uterus would be removed upon excessive postpartum bleeding. Under Pelvic Arterial Embolization therapy, however, the bleeding is stopped by blocking the blood flow to the uterine artery by inserting a thin catheter into the uterine artery through a small incision in the groin. Because this therapy does not require the removal of the uterus, patients can have more children later.<br /><br />The PAE is a safe and effective therapy which controls postpartum bleeding by inserting a thin catheter into the uterine artery through a small incision in the groin and blocking the torn vessel wall.<br /><br />AMC has accomplished the greatest achievement of performing the most cases in the world as a single institution, and proved its safe, effective, high quality skills for PAE to the globe.<br /><br />Professor Shin released the results of the study at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology in Chicago on March 26.<br /><br />[AMC International News, May 2011]
