The saddest moment is when your phone is dead or your phone runs out of battery and a you have text or call waiting. This could happen especially you are away from your house probably in camping etc. <br /><br />Hope this simple trick and life hacks can help you to charge your phone in such emergency situations.<br /><br />In this video, I had used 9 volts to light up the car charger.
