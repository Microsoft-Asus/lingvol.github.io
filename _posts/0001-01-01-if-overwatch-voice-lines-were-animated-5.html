This episode features Torbjorn walking a baby turret in the park, Widowmaker taking Chris to bed, Bastion having a rap battle with the law, and Doomfist blowing things up. <br /><br />Previous we did episodes with Tracer, Solder 76, Reinhardt, McCree, Pharrah, Lucio, D.va, Genji, Mercy, and many others. Those episodes are available on our SmashBits Animations youtube channel. Also check out the playlist for all the episodes.<br /><br />Thank you so much to Blizzard for making this awesome first-person shooter video game.<br /><br />Written and directed by Chris Durgin<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chrisdurg">https://twitter.com/chrisdurg</a>
