She's extremely complicated and misunderstood. She actually banishes herself from her home to avoid hurting others, and in return, she finds the liberation to celebrate who she is.&quot;<br /><br />The celebration is marked by the song &quot;Let It Go,&quot; and the character undergoes a profound transformation—inside and out. &quot;Before 'Let It Go,'&quot; says character design supervisor Bill Schwab, &quot;Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone.&quot;<br /><br />Frozen is available on Digital HD &amp; 3D and Blu-ray, DVD &amp; On-Demand in the UK with never-before-seen bonus extras to complement the film's gorgeous animation, memorable characters and unforgettable music.<br /><br /><br />The Disney UK YouTube channel brings you a wealth of official video content from all the Disney movies and characters you know and love.
