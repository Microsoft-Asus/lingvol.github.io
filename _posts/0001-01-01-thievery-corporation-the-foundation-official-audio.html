Official audio from Thievery Corporation's &quot;Sounds From the Thievery Hi-Fi.&quot;<br />Get the Album: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thieverycorporation.com/thieveryhifi/">https://thieverycorporation.com/thieveryhifi/</a><br /><br />// ESL090: Available Through ESL Music //<br /><br />When they met in the mid-1990s, Thievery Corporation's Eric Hilton and Rob Garza instantly bonded over a shared passion for bossa nova and dub. This chance meeting in Washington, DC set the duo on a journey that begins in 1996 with the release of their debut studio album, Sounds From the Thievery Hi-Fi. Originally released in Germany before appearing in the US on June 7, 1997, the duo's first album set the beat for a 20+ year dance through dub, bossa nova, trip-hop, electronica, acid jazz, lounge, and laid-back grooves.<br /><br />// GET SOUNDS FROM THE THIEVERY HI-FI //<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thieverycorporation.com/thieveryhifi/">https://thieverycorporation.com/thieveryhifi/</a><br /><br />// FOLLOW THIEVERY CORPORATION // <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thieverycorporation.com">http://thieverycorporation.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/thieverycorporation">http://youtube.com/thieverycorporation</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/thieverycorporation">http://facebook.com/thieverycorporation</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/thieverycorpdc">http://twitter.com/thieverycorpdc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/thieverycorporation">http://instagram.com/thieverycorporation</a>
