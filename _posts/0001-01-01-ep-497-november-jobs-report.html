According to the BLS, 245,000 jobs were created in the month of November. This was well below market expectations and where jobs gains had been over the last several months. Perhaps portending of a loss of momentum within the jobs market. Such a situation, would however, be consistent with other data that we have been witnessing with respect to initial jobless claims remaining stubbornly high at over 700,000 per week. Such a small monthly gain is also consistent with recent small business surveys that indicate that nearly half of these businesses remain at risk of closing for good. Those industries hardest hit are continuing to feel the brunt of the economic contraction and the narrative is showing consistency across various reports and surveys. Thus, indicating to The Kapital News, that there is still a long way to go with respect to the recovery of employment. It should also be noted that elements within the Nobody CARES Act are expiring at the end of the month. Therefore, those who may be losing their jobs for the first time, will likely qualify for state benefits. However, those that typically do not qualify for state benefits, such as small business owners, contractors, gig workers etc, have been relying on the PUA and/or PEUC programs created in the Nobody CARES Act, will run into a problem as these programs are set to expire. These two programs were also available as an extension if and once, state benefits expired. Lastly, the headline U-3 unemployment rate was 6.7 percent for the month of November. However, per the BLS, if calculated &quot;more accurately,&quot; the rate would have been 7.1 percent.
