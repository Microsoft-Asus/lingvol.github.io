This video answers the question: What potential personality characteristics were present in the Chris Watts murders (Watts family murders)? There are a number of theories about these murders including those involving psychopathy, narcissism, rage, impulsivity, and infidelity.<br /><br />The details of these murders are horrific. In 2018, Chris Watts (33 at the time) murdered his wife (Shanann Watts, 34, who was 15 weeks pregnant), and his daughters (Bella, 4 &amp; Celeste, 3). Chris was involved in an affair at the time with Nichol Lee Kessinger (30 at the time).<br /><br />Psychopathy:<br /><br />There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.<br /><br />Narcissism:<br /><br />There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.<br /><br />Westfall, S.
