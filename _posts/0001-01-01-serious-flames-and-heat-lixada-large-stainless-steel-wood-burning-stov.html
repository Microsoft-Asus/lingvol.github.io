This is made for large pots, big pans and would be great for larger groups. Before purchasing this stove, I would ask yourself whether or not you need the size as it is large.<br /><br />Should be mentioned that the design isn’t anything unique or special and in fact, there are many companies who make the same product but with a different company logo on it. This is the least expensive version that I have seen but it wouldn’t surprise me at all if there was another company out there who was selling it for less.<br /><br />Performance is good, it’s of a large size, can burned for a long time and can put out a lot of heat.<br />...<br /><br />Web Site, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram :<br /><br />Web Site : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.theoutdoorgearreview.com">http://www.theoutdoorgearreview.com</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Outdoor-Gear-Review/281509538652229">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Outdoor-Gear-Review/281509538652229</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OutdoorGearRev">https://twitter.com/OutdoorGearRev</a><br /><br />Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theoutdoorgearreview/">https://www.instagram.com/theoutdoorgearreview/</a><br />.....
