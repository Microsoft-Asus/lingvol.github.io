The CoverProÂ® 1000CPX's innovative design is based on the marriage of an industrial-style cover hem machine and a convenient home machine. The resulting union has produced a high-speed, long arm, heavy-duty cover hem machine that looks and operates like a sewing machine. With a wide trip cover hem stitch, exclusive free arm configuration, and Janome's Seam Tightening Systemâ„¢ (STS), the 1000CPX is the most advanced Cover Hem machine available.<br /><br />Included In Box:<br />Needle Set<br />Screwdrivers<br />Tweezers<br />Needle Threader<br />Lint Brush<br />Accessory Box<br /><br />Pink Castle Fabrics is a family business started by Brenda and Jason in February of 2011. At the beginning, &quot;warehouse&quot; was located in the basement of our home in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Brenda had just begun quilting, and had a hard time finding fabric she liked at prices that Jason liked. Pink Castle Fabrics opened their own brick and mortar location in June of 2013.<br /><br />HUGE thank you to Pink Castle Fabrics for making these videos possible! I personally know Brenda and Jason - they are committed to offering you the best customer service no matter where you're located.
