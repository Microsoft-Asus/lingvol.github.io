Foam Rolling with a Tennis ball or other similar objects to help keep the underside of the foot flexible. <br /><br />In this video, We will teach you the basics of how to foam roll, why foam rolling is important especially for child athletes.  Now not everyone has a foam roller and it is difficult to particular foam roll the underside of the foot. <br /><br />the underside of the foot is important to keep flexible and strong just like any muscle in the body, However, the planter side of the foot is important because as athletes it affects our ability to dorciflex (that being toes facing the sky), thusly protecting the Achilles tendon and cath msucles. <br />Foam rolling or myofascial release is great for all ages and acts like a self-massage, which can aid in recovery from exercise.<br /><br />A foam roller is a lightweight, cylindrical tube of compressed foam. It may be used for many reasons, including increasing flexibility, reducing soreness, and eliminating muscle knots. Foam rolling is a method of self-myofascial release ( Which is a very effective technique involving applying gentle sustained pressure into the Myofascial connective tissue which can help to eliminate pain and restore motion). Rollers come in different sizes and degrees of firmness and types/style of foam rollers. <br /><br />#shorts<br />#short<br />#short video
