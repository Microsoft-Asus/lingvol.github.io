Highly intelligent people may seem to have it better in life, but these struggles prove that isn’t always the case! Intelligence is defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. When someone refers to you as being intelligent, they imply that you are special in terms of brain function and general conduct. <br /><br />That being said, it’s easy to assume that having a high IQ would come with several privileges. For example, you wouldn't have to study as hard for tests. You'd read about complicated concepts and be able to grasp them immediately. In fact, all that may be true! But, there are difficulties and challenges that only highly intelligent people will experience.<br /><br />Besides these struggles, there are several personality traits of highly intelligent people that set them apart from the rest. Many of these traits have to do with their intense feelings and emotions. Others, with their distinctive socially awkward interactions. These traits often make them misunderstood and underestimated.<br /><br />The research in this video simply outlines some of the most common struggles that only highly intelligent people have.<br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Music: YouTube Audio Library<br />Visuals: Adobe Stock / Pexels / Pixabay / Other<br />Voice-over Recording, Audio &amp; Video Production by Brainy Dose<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------
