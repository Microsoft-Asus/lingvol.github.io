Today in episode 45 of Couple Things with Shawn and Andrew, we sit down and have a discussion all of you have been asking us about.... a second kid. <br /><br />We talk about our thoughts and hesitations with having another child; what we're fearful, anxious, but most importantly, excited about. <br /><br />A few topics we cover: <br />- will we have enough time for another child? <br />- how will this affect Drew? <br />- can we love another child as much as we love her? <br />- how does that fit into our lifestyle? <br />- what if there are complications? <br /><br />We really get deep in this one, but it's a conversation we are excited to bring you. Let us know if there is anything we missed or should be considering at a time like this. <br /><br />If you haven’t yet, please rate Couple Things and subscribe to hear more.
