{% raw %}We would like to acknowledge this is a brief overview of the care of an Intensive Care patient. We recognise that each patientâ€™s care is individual, each department and organisation work to their own policies and protocols.  These resources have been rapidly developed within the midst of increasing pressure on Critical Care capacity.  This not meant to replace any formal training / education but to be used as a refresher and or broad guide to the care of an intubated intensive care patient.  It has not been made COVID-19 specific. <br /> <br />Further resources can be found on the British Association of Critical Care Nurses webpage: www.baccn.org{% endraw %}
