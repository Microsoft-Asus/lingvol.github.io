On Wednesday, November 25, 2020, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) joined Ali Velshi on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show to discuss President Trump's repeated abuse of the pardon power to reward political allies and protect himself, including his pardon of Michael Flynn. Schiff said Trump's actions demonstrate that our system can be exploited by foreign powers.<br /> <br />During the interview, Schiff said, “One of the premises behind our Constitution is that no one is a judge of their own case. We are bound by the rule of law. We are a nation of laws, not individuals. If a president could commit any crime he wanted and simply pardon himself, it would be self-defeating.”<br />--- <br />Join the conversation: <br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.schiff.house.gov">https://www.schiff.house.gov</a><br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff">https://www.facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff</a><br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff">https://www.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff</a><br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/RepAdamSchiff">https://www.instagram.com/RepAdamSchiff</a>
