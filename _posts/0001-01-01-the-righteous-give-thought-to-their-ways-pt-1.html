Zechariah 8:6-8 This is what YAHAWAH Almighty says: &quot;It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?&quot; declares YAHAWAH Almighty. This is what YAHAWAH Almighty says: &quot;I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west. I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.&quot;<br /><br />Isaiah 42:6-9 &quot;I, YAHAWAH, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. &quot;I am YAHAWAH; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.&quot;<br /><br />Ezekiel 11:17-19 &quot;Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign YAHAWAH says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.' &quot;They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.<br /><br />Ezekiel 34:11-14 &quot;'For this is what the Sovereign YAHAWAH says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
