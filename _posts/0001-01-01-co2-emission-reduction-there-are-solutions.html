this video explains which options exist to reconcile our growing need for electrical energy with the fight against climate change when electricity production represents nearly half of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere. The &quot;three levers  strategy&quot; Alstom proposes to address the issue  consists of larger use of renewable power sources, better efficiency of thermal power plants, and implementation of CO2 capture technologies.
