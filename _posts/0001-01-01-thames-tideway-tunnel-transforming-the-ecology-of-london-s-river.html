{% raw %}Once completed the Thames Tideway Tunnel will be Europe’s longest and deepest continuous tunnel, travelling 25km through central London to intercept untreated sewage discharges that spill into the tidal Thames and pollute the city’s iconic river. The Thames Tideway Tunnel will create a cleaner, healthier River Thames and improve the quality of life for all Londoners.{% endraw %}
