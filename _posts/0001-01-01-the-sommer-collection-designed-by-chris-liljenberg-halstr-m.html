What does Sommer feel like?<br />Danish designer Chris Liljenberg Halstrøm designed the Sommer Collection to be tactile – she wants people to be inspired and challenged by the sense of touch. For the seating in Sommer, she created a new, synthetic version of Danish paper-cord, a material traditionally woven to create chair seats that have a bit of give to them. Halstrøm’s weatherproof, matte weave similarly responds to sunbathers’ shifting positions while protecting their arms and legs from sunbaked surfaces.
