A VIDEO has caught the moment an exploding iPhone forced a woman to bolt from her car on a busy motorway in China as the deadly gadget kept catching fire.<br /><br />The footage, obtained by Asia Wire, shows the woman driving along when her phone suddenly pops and emits a small flame followed by an even larger eruption just seconds later.<br /><br />The woman hesitated after the technology fail but carries on driving due to the moving traffic and to avoid obstructing the innermost lane.<br /><br />Smoke can be seen filling the car as it continues to roll along the motorway.<br /><br />Then, some 20 seconds later, her iPhone 6 abruptly explodes again, leaving her screaming and slamming on the brakes.<br /><br />The woman can be heard getting out of her car and continuing to cry and scream while standing on the road, with other drivers passing her.<br /><br />She tells a motorist who has stopped to check on her: &quot;My phone exploded! My phone exploded!&quot;<br /><br />It appears the explosion was caused by the phone's faulty battery, which had been replaced at a repair shop in China in February, according to the woman's husband.<br /><br />He said: &quot;She was driving alone; no one touched the phone. It just suddenly blew up. She wasn't charging or even using it at the time<br /><br />&quot;When we bought the battery...in February, they told us it was genuine,&quot; he explained, adding: &quot;They're refusing to take further responsibility and won't compensate us.&quot;<br /><br />He continued: &quot;We asked them for a new phone. They say they can only give us a second-hand one. It's like they're squeezing us like a tube of toothpaste. They'll squeeze us until we run out of patience and give up, then the case is closed for them.&quot;<br /><br />Some social media users on Chinese platforms, however, are showing little sympathy for the couple for leaving the iPhone on the dashboard in the baking sun.<br /><br />&quot;It's extremely hot in the summer and you leave your phone exposed to the sun. It's obviously going to explode, you idiot! And you're blaming the phone?&quot; wrote Abren Guanxianshi.<br /><br />Temperatures in Shanghai's Minhang district, where the woman was driving, are currently even hotter than in the UK, reaching a peak of 37-degrees Celsius this week.<br /><br />On its website, Apple warns that long-term exposure to the sun or heat can cause permanent damage to the blower's batteries.<br /><br />And as the case of randomly exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones proved in 2016, lithium-ion batteries can combust if they're damaged or defective.<br /><br />The fact that this phone's battery was replaced at an allegedly dodgy repairs shop could also be to blame...<br /><br />Continues:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6975674/exploding-iphone-car-motorway/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6975674/exploding-iphone-car-motorway/</a><br /><br />For more great videos, pictures and stories please subscribe to the channel and go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">http://www.thesun.co.uk</a>
