When it comes to asking the question - how do you structure a creative agency? - there's no monolithic answer. Every agency and creative studio is different. It's largely based on what the founder is good at, and what they're bad at. The idea is to lead with your strengths, and delegate your weaknesses. <br /><br />At Butler Branding, we think about our organization hierarchy in terms of two teams: the brand management team, and the creative fulfillment team. In this video, Sean discusses how we are structured and how we operate at Butler Branding. <br /><br /><br />RESOURCES:<br />Project Management Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://agency.butlerbranding.com/project-management/">https://agency.butlerbranding.com/project-management/</a><br /><br />.......................................................................... <br /><br />Butler Branding is a full-service branding and marketing agency.
