TL; DW:<br /><br />GG.BET banned me without any concrete evidence of the offense that was pinned on me. Resulting in a lock of my available balance and a lengthy email conversation that led absolutely nowhere. <br />If GG.BET wants to regain their &quot;good name&quot; they need to answer for what happened.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I would like to share my personal experience, which is no different from thousands of negative reviews about this bookie. <br />If you were considering if trust this bookmaker or not, then my advice to you RUN AWAY. <br />Gambling is fun as long as you have full control over your actions if you're getting too carried away with the adrenaline of gambling, I advise to stay away from this activity in general.
