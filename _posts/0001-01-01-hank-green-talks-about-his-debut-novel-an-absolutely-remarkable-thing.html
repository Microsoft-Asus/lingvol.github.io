In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green—cocreator of &quot;Crash Course,&quot; &quot;Vlogbrothers&quot; and &quot;SciShow&quot;—spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined. Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, &quot;An Absolutely Remarkable Thing&quot; grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring for the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye. The beginning of an exciting fiction career, Green's book is a bold and insightful novel of now.<br /><br />BUILD is a live interview series like no other—a chance for fans to sit inches away from some of today’s biggest names in entertainment, tech, fashion and business as they share the stories behind their projects and passions.
