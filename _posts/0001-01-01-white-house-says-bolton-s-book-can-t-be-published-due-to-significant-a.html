백악관 &quot;볼턴 책, 기밀 누설로 출간 안돼&quot;... 볼턴 &quot;기밀 없어&quot;<br /><br />White House says Bolton's book can't be published due to &quot;significant amount&quot; of classified information<br /><br />Let's start our international news in Washington...<br />The White House says the upcoming book by President Trump's former top national security aide John Bolton can't be published.<br />For more on this and other news around the world, let's turn to our Yoon Jung-min.<br />Jung-min, this face-off between Bolton and his former boss is boiling over as the impeachment trial rumbles on in the U.S. Senate.<br />Right, Conn-young. The White House's National Security Council says Bolton's unpublished book contains &quot;significant amounts&quot; of classified information, so it cannot be published.<br />This comes as Democrats are pressing to summon the former National Security Advisor for testimony in the impeachment trial.<br />The NSC said in a letter to Bolton's lawyer that the manuscript may not be disclosed without removing the classified information, mentioning Bolton's duty to stick to non-disclosure agreements.<br />Bolton's attorney Charles Cooper says the letter was dated January 23rd.<br />The Washington Post reports that Cooper denied the White House's claims,... saying the book does not contain anything classified.<br />The attorney added his client is currently preparing for the possibility that the Senate might subpoena him to testify.<br />Earlier, the New York Times published details of the book,...  sparking a frenzy on Capitol Hill.<br />The manuscript reportedly says President Trump told Bolton in August that he wanted to freeze 391-million dollars of aid to Ukraine until the country helped him investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son over allegations of corruption.<br />Following the New York Times report, President Trump took to Twitter, saying he never told Bolton such things and called the book &quot;nasty and untrue.&quot;<br />Bolton's book, &quot;The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,&quot; is slated to go on sale on March 17th.<br /><br />#WhiteHouse #Bolton #book <br /><br />Arirang News Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews">http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews</a>
