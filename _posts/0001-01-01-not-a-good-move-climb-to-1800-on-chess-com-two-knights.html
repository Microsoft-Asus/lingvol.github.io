As you'll see in these videos I cross 1700 without too much trouble!  A result of diligent study no doubt!  And now I'm going for the next climb.  I was rated 1000 just six years ago.  This bodes well for my ultimate goal of going for that IM title!  Ambitious?  Yes, I know but I love the adventure.  :)  <br /><br />Hope you enjoy the journey with me!<br />Stacia{% endraw %}
