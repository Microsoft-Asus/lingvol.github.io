You can use fresh dill and garlic if you have them...or store-bought dried dill and processed garlic. Your family will love them either way. These pickles are fully processed and will keep on the shelf for a year or more. Sorry I gave confusing recipe amounts: the actual measures are 4 cups of vinegar; 4 cups of water; 3 cups of sugar; and one third cup of coarse salt for the brine.
