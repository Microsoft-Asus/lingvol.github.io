Hi!<br /><br />Exciting additions abound in this new multi-stage, timed score level, featuring 2 new enemies, a foodie Chickful A and a fancy welcome sign! It's a barrel of fun, and not too difficult - even I can do it - I'd recommend giving it a go!<br /><br />The stage comes/came out 4th November 2016, 11am, and is/was available for 10 days.<br /><br />Regit<br /><br />If the music was Ben Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bensound.com">http://www.bensound.com</a><br /><br />If the music was ProleteR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/proleterbeats">https://www.youtube.com/user/proleterbeats</a><br /><br />If the music was Kevin Macleod:<br /><br />&quot;&quot;<br />Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>
