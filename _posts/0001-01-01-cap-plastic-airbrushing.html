Cap plastic has been used to make baldcaps for years and is often used as a material to encapsulate silicone appliances as it gives you a blendable edge and a surface which can take glue and paint. <br /><br /><br />How that cap plastic is applied to the mould surface is important, and the options are usually airbrush or conventional paintbrush.<br />In this video, Iâ€™ll take a look airbrushes and compressors used, as well as comparing the results of cap plastic applied by airbrush and a paintbrush. <br /><br />If you want more prosthetic makeup information, check out our podcast, Battles With Bits of Rubber, found wherever there are podcasts.
