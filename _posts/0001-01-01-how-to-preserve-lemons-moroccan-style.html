{% raw %}www.recipe30.com (for full recipe)<br /><br />It amazes me how expensive preserved lemons can be for a small jar, yet having my own lemon tree, they cost me around one dollar to make for a large jar.  A common North African condiment and delicacy, the flavor is mildly tart  with an intense lemon flavor.  Commonly used in tagines with chicken or lamb dishes, in rice and soups.  Great with roast chickens or with seafood.  Start to preserve your own lemons Moroccan style now.{% endraw %}
