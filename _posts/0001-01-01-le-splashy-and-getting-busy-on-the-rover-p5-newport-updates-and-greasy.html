Hi Everyone! This week I painted the Renault Winter Beater entry, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out! Agent 673 is here to head up the restoration of the Rover 3-litre, so we had better start by getting it properly apart! Another update from Agent 6667 as he gets his abandoned Chrysler Newport closer to roadworthy, and a visit to Dean's for another Greasy Flip!<br />  Thanks also to everyone who subscribed to our channel here, and thanks also for all of your &quot;likes&quot; and comments!
