{% raw %}10 series you need to binge if you liked Queen's Gambit<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />There’s a common problem with every single Netflix hit that comes out. As soon as you finish the series you’re left with this gaping hole in your life. In late 2020, that problem is called The Queen’s Gambit and unfortunately the wait for season two is forever. You see, QG is a Netflix limited series, meaning that there will be no more adventures with Beth Harmon and her chess addiction. This is terrible news for all those fans out there who have bought a brand new chess board and copies of every Anya Taylor-Joy movie from Thoroughbreds and The Witch to The New Mutants. Luckily, Netflix has a GIANT library filled with fantastic hit series, hidden gems from other countries and long running series that I’m sure you’ve been meaning to get to.<br /><br />We’ll cover shows like The Crown that offer quite a bit of the gorgeous visuals from a bygone era just like The Queen’s Gambit. It also has plenty of strategizing and intrigue. Being a British royal is about as close to living in a chessboard as possible. We’ll also cover shows like Peaky Blinders which may or may not have a certain actress in it that everyone loves from Queen’s Gambit. We will also go over hidden gems like Money Heist that you may have heard of but haven’t pulled the trigger on yet. That’s just the beginning though!<br /><br />So let’s dive into all the shows to watch after The Queen’s Gambit!<br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:24 The Crown<br />1:18 Ratched<br />2:10 Peaky Blinders<br />2:59 Money Heist<br />3:25 The Haunting of Hill House<br />4:00 Good Girls<br />4:45 Dracula<br />5:15 Outlander<br />6:02 Jessica Jones<br />6:48 Glow<br />7:42 Outro<br /><br />Check out the Behind The Screen Podcast - By Screen Rant on Spotify!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6sMJkP1E4N7kPYL5v9OW3v">https://open.spotify.com/show/6sMJkP1E4N7kPYL5v9OW3v</a><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screenrant">https://twitter.com/screenrant</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/</a><br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screenrant.com/">http://screenrant.com/</a><br /><br />Written by: Jordan Phillips<br />Narrated by: Justin Freitas<br />Edited by: MA<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
