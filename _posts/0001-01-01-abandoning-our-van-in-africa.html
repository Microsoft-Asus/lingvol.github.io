As it has for so, so many of us, this global pandemic has absolutely flipped our world upside down. What went from a virus that seemed far away in China, quickly made it’s way across the globe forcing us to quarantine in our 60 sq-ft in Morocco. And while quarantining was going well for us it became apparent that things would be different for a long while.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. The gravity of what we’ve just done hasn’t quite sunk in and we ((especially me (Bec)) are having a really hard time adjusting to our new reality.  Having said that we think the most important thing we can all do now is STAY HOME, keep healthy with healing foods &amp; try to look at this as a time that we (and the planet) desperately needed to reset and realign.  Sending each of you so much love throughout this time x<br /><br />✳ Eamon &amp; Bec Products ✳<br />↠ our handmade chai blends <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chaiwalachai.com/">https://chaiwalachai.com/</a> ↞<br />↠ our plant-based cookbook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups">https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups</a> ↞<br />↠ our beautiful photo filters <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets">https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets</a> ↞<br /><br />Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:<br />VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/newvantour">http://bit.ly/newvantour</a><br /><br />OVERLANDING AFRICA IN OUR SPRINTER VAN has been the adventure we’ve always hoped it would be but it’s hard to predict what happens next. In fact, we are still processing everything that has happened over the last week and continues to happen... No one knows where we will end up, where our beloved tiny home on wheels will make it or for how long this pandemic will take over life as we know but all we can do is try to remain positive and move forward in the direction that feels right for us. We hope you are all keeping safe during this time ❤️.<br /><br />Want updates in between videos? <br />►Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/eamonandbec">https://instagram.com/eamonandbec</a><br /><br />What's in Our Camera Bag? <br />For a blog post on our camera gear click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eamonandbec.com/blog">https://www.eamonandbec.com/blog</a><br />Secret Weapon to our Steady Shots <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3c327xq">https://amzn.to/3c327xq</a><br />The Lens that Does it All <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Tb88zq">https://amzn.to/2Tb88zq</a><br />Main Camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38X6fNw">https://amzn.to/38X6fNw</a><br />How We Shoot a Timelapse <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VgAOcQ">https://amzn.to/2VgAOcQ</a><br />Our Flying Camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38U5TqB">https://amzn.to/38U5TqB</a><br />Starting a Vlog?
