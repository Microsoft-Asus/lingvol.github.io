KDP Earnings and Online Income November 2020 - Building a Passive Income<br /><br />New to KDP Publishing? - Start Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3i3f78K">https://bit.ly/3i3f78K</a><br /><br />Gumroad Store for Interiors and Keywords: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3byyGTX">https://bit.ly/3byyGTX</a><br /><br />Finally into the last month of Q4 and the online sales of KDP no content and low content books have increased as expected. But by how much? My online income comprises KDP books published on Amazon and a gradually increasing proportion from Youtube, which includes advertising revenue, affiliate sales and digital product sales. All have increased this year due to commitment to regular growth.  KDP book sales are a great way to build a passive income - you put the work in up front by creating no content and low content books, upload them to Amazon as digital files and then, hopefully, make continuing sales each month. It is not a fast way to riches and does involve learning the process and committing to creating books regularly. <br /><br />In this channel I have many videos on how to create KDP Amazon books and build an online income.
