{% raw %}Here‚Äôs your daily stimulus check, your second stimulus check, your executive action, executive order, memorandums, moratoriums, and stimulus package update for Saturday, December 12th, 2020.<br /><br />üí∞ LIMITED TIME: Get 2 FREE STOCKS ON WEBULL when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400) üí∞   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2VFGQCC">https://bit.ly/2VFGQCC</a><br /><br /><br />JOIN ME ON PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nZMQmM">https://bit.ly/3nZMQmM</a><br /><br /><br />Congresswoman Katie Porter told Yahoo Finance that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is to blame for stalled stimulus negotiations. <br /><br />Porter explained that McConnell was ‚Äúrefusing‚Äù to bring a stimulus vote to the floor unless an aid package ‚Äúwipes away all virus related lawsuits filed that allege injury or death due to corporate negligence.‚Äù<br /><br />McConnell has offered to drop business liability demands in exchange for Democrats backing away from calls for billions in aid for local municipalities. <br /><br />Porter explained, ‚ÄòThis is not what the American people are asking for. They need help keeping food on the table. They need help keeping food on the table. They need help keeping a roof over their head.‚Äù<br /><br />State and local government funding mean unemployment funds and as we all know unemployment is a lifeline for so many.<br /><br />Sen. Josh Hawley and Bernie Sanders are warning they will use next Friday‚Äôs deadline to try to force a vote on the second round of stimulus checks.<br /><br />Sanders said during a floor speech, ‚ÄúWe cannot go back to our families during the Christmas holidays while tens of millions of families are suffering.‚Äù<br /><br />Hawley added that there is ‚Äúno reason that this body should leave next week before we vote on and approve direct assistance to working families.‚Äù<br /><br />Hawley and Sanders, typically political polar opposites, have teamed up to push for a second round of stimulus checks in their $350 billion relief bill. <br /><br />And finally, after facing a series of delays the Senate and President Trump have approved a one-week government funding extension bill to avoid a Government Shutdown ahead of the deadline. <br /><br />The Senate passed the measure in a voice vote earlier in the day, and the House approved it this week.<br /><br />The law funds the government through Dec. 18th and funding would have lapsed today if Washington failed to pass a spending plan.<br /><br />Appropriators have agreed on a $1.4 trillion price tag for legislation to keep the government running through Sept. 30th, 2021. <br /><br />Congressional leaders hope to pass both a full-year appropriations package and relief aid before the Dec. 18th deadline. <br /><br />Hopefully, this means they can finally do their jobs and try to get us our money now that they have theirs.<br /><br /><br /><br />That was your stimulus check, your second stimulus check, your executive action, and stimulus package update for Friday, December 12th, 2020.<br /><br /><br /> Sources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/529858-sanders-hawley-vow-fight-next-week-over-stimulus-checks">https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/529858-sanders-hawley-vow-fight-next-week-over-stimulus-checks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/11/945388153/demands-over-covid-19-relief-delay-action-on-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown">https://www.npr.org/2020/12/11/945388153/demands-over-covid-19-relief-delay-action-on-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sen-mc-connell-is-kowtowing-to-his-large-corporate-donors-says-rep-porter-on-stalled-stimulus-153110984.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sen-mc-connell-is-kowtowing-to-his-large-corporate-donors-says-rep-porter-on-stalled-stimulus-153110984.html</a><br /><br /><br />üìóBUY MY BOOK THE ORIGIN OF OPPORTUNITY!!!üìó<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hb68ST">https://amzn.to/3hb68ST</a><br /><br />üè† Real Estate Masters Course<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://andrewcartwright.podia.com/real-estate-mastery-course">https://andrewcartwright.podia.com/real-estate-mastery-course</a><br /><br />üíºüï∫Sale Like a PRO <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://andrewcartwright.podia.com/salesprogram">https://andrewcartwright.podia.com/salesprogram</a><br /><br />NOTICE OF RISK: Content is for News &amp; Entertainment purposes only.
