I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. <br /><br />I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.<br /><br />Don’t forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />🎬CREDITS:<br />DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Bret Hamilton<br />CAMERA OPERATOR » Nguyễn Tân Khải<br />VIDEO EDITOR » Lê Anh Đỗ<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER » Quí Nguyễn<br />PRODUCER » Harshita Kalra<br /><br />For business inquiries, please email: team.befrs@gmail.com
