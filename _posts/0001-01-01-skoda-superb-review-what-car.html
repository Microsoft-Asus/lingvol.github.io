The Skoda Superb is bigger than most large executive cars, yet is cheaper than many family cars. It’s also generously equipped, has a classy cabin and should be painless to own, so is an excellent choice.<br /><br />The Superb has a hugely spacious, high-quality interior. It’s also competitively priced, well equipped and offers a wide range of economical, tax-efficient engines. However, its suspension struggles to stay settled on battered UK roads and other family cars are more fun to drive.<br /><br />What do you think of the Skoda Superb?
