{% raw %}Soooo this is my new subscription box that I decided to try.  This is a monthly 'art' box, which if you watch my video you will know is not my thing, however making things and being creative and crafty is!  <br /><br />Artful is £35 per quarter and I used FIVEOFF  as this gives you £5 off your first box.  Having looked at Hobbycraft to compare prices, this box is well worth the price for all the things included, especially when it comes with what they call a magazine, but is actually a many paged book!<br /><br />Let me know in the comments if you have ever tried lino printing before.<br /><br />Please like and subscribe.<br /><br /><br />My son's wishlist.  I've already told him he won't receive anything, but did promise to add it for him!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2MJAXF10NBNIK?&amp;sort=default">https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2MJAXF10NBNIK?&amp;sort=default</a>{% endraw %}
