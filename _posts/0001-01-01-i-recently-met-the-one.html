Why it’s better to focus on being a great dater, great lover and enjoying your life and your experiences with members of the opposite sex, instead of focusing on finding or meeting “the one” and how this actually leads to unhealthy attachments, obsession and rejection.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter, I discuss an email from a viewer who is starting to delude himself into believing that he has finally met “the one” perfect girl for him to be the answer to all of his relationship fantasies. He is projecting his dating fantasy onto this woman and starting to ignore the reality of her situation, the way she really is and how she treats him. He’s putting her on a pedestal and starting to be extra nice, beta male and submissive so he does not screw things up. However, she is recently out of an eight-year relationship with the father of her child. He’s starting to over-pursue and focus on what he is not getting from her. He also says he wants to start helping other people with their dating life before he has actually learned what to do himself. I give him a reality check and tell him what he really needs to focus on so he can achieve the success he wants for himself, and so he will be able to help other people effectively down the road if he chooses to become a coach.<br /><br />“Experience and failure are life’s best teachers. The more things you try in life, the more you will fail. Becoming ok with failure is essential to eventually becoming a success through your experiences. There is no shortcut to success. When it comes to dating, many people project their ideal fantasy onto potential new lovers while ignoring the reality of what they are really like. This leads to unhealthy attachments and becoming stuck on people who don’t, won’t or can’t reciprocate interest. This literally takes them out of circulation, stops their learning, forward progress and actually prevents them from meeting the right person for them since they are no longer open to or looking for someone who actually meets their needs. In order to meet the right person, you must be available, ready, happy, open to it happening, comfortable in your own skin and have space in your life for someone to fill.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
