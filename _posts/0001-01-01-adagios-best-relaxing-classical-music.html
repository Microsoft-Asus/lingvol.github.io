This special collection of beautiful and serene adagios will help you do just that. The set features over two hours of soothing music, including many slow movements that are at the emotional core of timeless and best‐loved masterpieces. <br />You’ll be captivated by the variety of wonderful and instantly recognizable melodies heard here: the wistful spiritual from Dvořák’s ‘New World’ Symphony, the exquisite interweaving lines of Bach’s ‘Air on a G String’, and some of Mozart’s most impressive showcases for how to really make an instrument sing in the Clarinet Concerto and ‘Elvira Madigan’ Piano Concerto. And evocative and atmospheric adagios – such as Grieg’s ‘Morning’ and the slow movement from Beethoven’s ‘Pastoral’ Symphony with its distinctive birdsong calls in the flute, oboe and clarinet – will transport you to another world, far away from the stresses and strains of everyday life. Other highlights include some of the most enchanting slow movements in the piano repertoire – such as the poignant Adagio cantabile from Beethoven’s ‘Pathétique’ Sonata and stunning concerto movements by Chopin, Ravel and Rachmaninoff – Fauré’s intense Élégie for cello, and Mahler’s tender and heartbreakingly romantic Adagietto. The emotional power of these adagios is brought to the fore by first‐rate orchestras such as the Staatskapelle Dresden, Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic, under the baton of eminent conductors such as Theodore Kuchar, Herbert Blomstedt and Rudolf Barshai.  <br />A moment to relax, to withdraw from an increasingly hectic life, overfed with stimuli from work, society obligations and social networks: this music will calm down your jittery nerves, and will take you on slow waves of soothing melodies to a world of pure sound and tranquillity.  A generous selection of the most famous slow movements: Air (Bach), Adagio (Marcello), Adagio (Rachmaninoff 2nd piano concerto), Scene at the Brook (Beethoven’s Pastorale), The Adagietto from the movie ‘Death in Venice’ (Mahler) and many more.<br /><br />Excellent performances by Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra and soloists Klára Würtz and Misha Goldstein.  <br /><br />Tracklist:<br />00:00:00 J.S.
