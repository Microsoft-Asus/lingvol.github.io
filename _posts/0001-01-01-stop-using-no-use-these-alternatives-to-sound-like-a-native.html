The word &quot;no&quot; is short, negative and emphatic. However, sometimes it's better to use more polite alternatives. There are a number of different ways to say &quot;no&quot; in English that you can use in different circumstances.<br />Download my English workbook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.english.online/">https://www.english.online/</a><br /><br />This video was filmed in this location (Palo Alto): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OQR2F0">https://bit.ly/2OQR2F0</a><br /><br />(1) FORMAL ALTERNATIVES<br />- I am afraid not<br />This is probably one of the most polite ways to say &quot;no&quot; in English. You may be asked to go to a party or meet your friends for something to eat. You would like to go but for some reason you are unable to attend. In this situation, you can turn down the invitation in a polite way.<br />- Not really<br />Not quite, not particularly. In this situation you are asked what you might like to do. You would prefer to do something else or indeed you might prefer to do nothing. <br />- Probably/possibly not<br />Where you may not feel that you are likely to succeed but you are still going to try then you can use either &quot;probably/possibly not&quot;.<br />- Not to my knowledge<br />This is a much more formal denial. This would be best used in a business context where you do not really know the person, to whom you are talking, very well.<br /><br />(2) INFORMAL ALTERNATIVES<br />- Certainly not<br />This is a much more firm denial or refusal and can be used when you want the person you are talking to, to be clear as to what you mean.<br />- You must be joking<br />When you cannot believe that someone is serious about something you can use the phrase &quot;you must be joking&quot;<br />- No way<br />Sometimes said as a joke or also as a more serious statement. Usually used to tell somebody that you cannot agree with what they have said.<br /><br />(3) CASUAL ALTERNATIVES<br />- I'm good<br />- Not right now<br />- Nah<br />- Nope<br />- Never<br /><br />Time codes:<br />0:00 Why using &quot;no&quot; is not always a good idea<br />1:07 Formal alternatives<br />3:58 What you need to know about Western culture<br />5:22 Informal alternatives<br />6:35 Important questions for you!<br />7:22 Informal alternatives<br />7:45 Casual alternatives<br />9:00 About my English workbook<br /><br />‚≠ê INSTAGRAM - linguamarina<br />‚≠ê LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linguatrip.com">https://linguatrip.com</a><br />‚≠ê ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf">https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf</a><br />‚≠ê DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.english.online/">https://www.english.online/</a><br /><br />üìù Get your English text corrected instantly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fluent.express/">https://fluent.express/</a><br /><br />üì∑ FILMING EQUIPMENT<br />- Gear for making my 'talking head' videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube">https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube</a><br />- Gear for vlogging - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup">https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup</a><br /><br />üéàPROMOS<br />$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ubr.to/2k1B89L">http://ubr.to/2k1B89L</a><br /><br />I use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)<br /><br />#StopOverusingNo #StopUsingNo #StopSayingNo
