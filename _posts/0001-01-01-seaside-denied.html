Every year the Sonic Paradox crew has an animation for the Summer of Sonic convention in the UK. Usually it is the Sonic Shorts but this year we made a music video for it. TheWax gave Recorderdude a few jokes about Sonic Heroes and he started on some lyrics for it. After we got the singers in, we started animating, which took around a week to a month to do for each animator. We hope you enjoy watching it as much as we did making it.<br /><br />Download the song at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/497607">http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/497607</a><br /><br />Follow Sonic Paradox on our different social media outlets!<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/SonicParadox">http://www.facebook.com/SonicParadox</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/Sonic_Paradox">http://www.twitter.com/Sonic_Paradox</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_sonicparadox_team/">https://www.instagram.com/the_sonicparadox_team/</a>
