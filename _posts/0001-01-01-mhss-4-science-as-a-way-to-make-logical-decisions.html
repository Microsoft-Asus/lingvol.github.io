For this session of Middleborough High Summer School, we have the incredible Gabrielle Dillon chatting with Science Communicator Danni Washington about how she thinks understanding science is a great way to learn how to make logical decisions in the current moment with a pandemic and significant climate change. Did you know that Danni is the first Black woman to host a science television show in the US? (!) Oh, and be sure to check out Danniâ€™s awesome ocean conservation initiative Big Blue and You. Class is now in session!
