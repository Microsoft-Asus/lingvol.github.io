{% raw %}Real patients describe how stroke affected their memory and cognitive skills, and how psychology helped them to address these issues.<br /><br />Key messages:<br />1. Half of all stroke survivors experience cognitive (thinking) problems.<br />2. Severity varies person to person, some cognitive problems may improve with time.<br />3. Difficulties with concentration, mental speed and understanding new information are most frequent.<br />4. Thinking difficulties can be influenced by mood and fatigue. A loss of thinking abilities can cause anxiety and low mood, or worse if a person is tired.<br />5. If problems are long lasting then it is important to help the person to find new ways of doing things.{% endraw %}
