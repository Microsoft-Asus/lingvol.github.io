Hey guys.<br /><br />We recently got a hold of a Deuce and a Half, that had served with the Norwegian army.<br /><br />These were made sightly different then the regular M35's <br />The series was just called M6-. rather then M35-<br /><br />We are going to fix it up. and that also means changing some things, so we just wanted to show it &quot;As is&quot;<br /><br />if you wanna know more then what we point out, feel free to ask.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching!
