This week's tutorial is somewhat of an extension of last week's. We'll be using shape layers to create a custom transition and saving it as an animation preset so you can use it any time! Also, learn how to get multiple transitions out of only one shape layer transition. <br /><br />This method of creating transitions is useful if you tend to use transitions on a regular basis, which is something that most motion graphic designers do, especially for infographics, explainer videos, corporate videos, pretty much anything. Once you create these transitions, you will always have them and they will be completely customizable. <br /><br />Learn an invaluable design skill in less than 7 minutes! Whether you're a beginner or an advanced motion graphics designer, these tutorials are designed to supplement designers at any level.<br /><br />Check back every week for a new episode. No BS... Just AE!
