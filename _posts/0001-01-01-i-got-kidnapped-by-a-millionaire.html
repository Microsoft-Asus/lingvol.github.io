I had to take care of an elderly woman, Mrs.Waters who was super rich, and I had to look after her mansion-home. My job was to cook for her, do her laundry, get her everything she needed, take her on walks in the garden, clean the house, and look after the house when she was traveling abroad for her treatments. I used to live there and without a family of my own, I felt like it was the perfect job for me.<br />Mrs.Waters on the other hand did have family, a lot of them but no one ever came to visit her, not on her birthdays or any other occasions, at least not in the 2 years I worked there.<br />But before we move on like this video, hit that ‘subscribe’ button and activate the notification bell and you’ll find out who has a crush on you soon! Trust me, it works.<br />For her sake, I would even make invitation cards and send them out but they would not show up.<br />“I appreciate what you’re doing child, but they would not come. They haven’t even called for years,” she would say trying to console me but I knew she was hurt inside.<br />However, even though no one from her family ever came to meet her, there was one member who was an exception, her grandson. His name was Casper and he was also super-rich like his grandma and had no parents like me. In fact, he had become a millionaire at just 20 from the incomes of his own business. He was also a bit handsome but too proud of a guy to even say hi to me once in all the times he visited.<br />I don’t know why he never talked to me so I made an assumption that it may be because of the difference in our status. He was a millionaire and I was just a poor caretaker after all.<br />He was nothing like his grandmother who was the sweetest. She always treated me better than anyone had ever treated me in life, very respectfully yet loving no matter how she was feeling.<br />I knew that she would feel lonely a lot of times and I felt really bad about it, so I tried my best to be the best company and make her happy when I was taking care of her. And it wasn’t that hard honestly. She was happy while feeding the birds, watering the plants, or when we played chess by the fireplace so it was an easy task.<br />But, she was getting older day by day and because of that, she was falling sick more often. I was just a caretaker and not a nurse so she had to make visits and stays at the hospital more often. She could have easily hired an in-house nurse but she didn’t want to do that because that meant there would be no more need for me.<br />“I like having you around,” she said whenever I brought up the topic.<br />But then, one day something unexpected happened. Her family showed up out of nowhere without any calls or invitations. Mrs.Waters son, Casper’s uncle, then fired me from my job while she was admitted to the hospital.<br />“You’re of no use; you’re not even a nurse. We’re going to live here with her so you can go your own way,” he said and made me leave so fast that I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye to Mrs.Waters. Her son and his wife and children were so mean.
