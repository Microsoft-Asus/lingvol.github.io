The Osmo Mobile 4 is out ! Is it light ? Is it sturdy ? <br />What’s new, what’s exactly the same as its predecessor? <br />Let's find out together in this video .<br /><br />I make videos every Monday (tutorials, reviews, vlogs) and every Thursday (Tech Talk Thursday). I can't wait to get my Osmo Mobile 4 !<br /><br />I translate all of my videos in French, so you'll see English subtitles in the parameters (I'm also making the English subtitles) and French subtitles. <br /><br />I really enjoy my gears and testing hi tech products. I'm making these videos out of passion and I really appreciate you being here !
