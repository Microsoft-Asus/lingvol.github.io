&quot;The song PERSONAL SHOPPER sits somewhere between being a love-letter to shopping (which I love to do!) and the uneasiness I feel about the more insidious side of modern consumerism. Lucrecia’s blackly comic video captures that dilemma perfectly.&quot; - Steven Wilson<br /><br />Pre-order the new album 'THE FUTURE BITES' - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/TheFutureBites">https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/TheFutureBites</a><br />Stream/buy 'PERSONAL SHOPPER': <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/PersonalShopper">https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/PersonalShopper</a><br /><br />“The track is a social criticism of consumerism and how we fill our lives with unnecessary goods to feel important, special or loved. But the truth is, the feeling of unhappiness won't go away with the next pair of sick trainers. Those feelings will only go away when we look within, and if we don't... well, then we're going to end up with a lot of stuff around us, but still pretty empty. Luckily the track being 6 minutes gave me the opportunity to develop an interesting narrative. I wanted to create a fictional world in which people buy goods and the transaction would not only be money but also a part of their body, alluding to the concept of the more you look for answers outside, the more you disappear on the inside.” Lucrecia Taormina, Director<br /><br />Director: Lucrecia Taormina <br />Executive producer: Luke Tierney<br />Production company: FRIEND<br />Producer: Joseph Goldman<br />Casting Agency: Lane Casting<br />Casting Director: Hannah Ashby Ward<br /><br />Cast:<br />The Consumer: Robert Lane<br />Cash Lady: Paula Benson<br />Shop Owner 1: Jill Buchanan<br />Shop Owner 2: Stephen Wale<br />Shop Owner 3: Amy Gallagher<br />Worshipper 1: Ocean Navarro<br />Worshipper 2: Karlu Solomon<br />The Thief: Romano Solano<br />The Shopper: Steven Wilson<br /><br />Director of Photography: Pieter Snyman<br />Editor: Meg Thorne<br />SFX: Natasha Lawes<br />Grade: Richard Fearon<br />Production Designer: Oliver Hogan<br />Movement Director: Simon Donnellon<br />Styling: Flora Huddart<br />Wigs, Hair &amp; Nails Artist: Natasha Lawes<br />Makeup Artist: Andrea Gomez Anzola<br /><br />TFB Product Rendering:<br />Miles Skarin, Crystal Spotlight<br /><br />VFX Artists:<br />Kelvin Chim, Steve Hawken, Rob Chandler, Abi Tomasiewicz<br /><br />Crew:<br />Production Manager: Hugo Holford<br />Production Coordinator: Ash Teague<br />First Assistant Director: Ty Hack<br />Second Assistant Director: Heini Susanne<br />Steadicam Operator: Doug Walshe<br />Focus Puller: Phil Heron<br />Grip: Charlie Wyldeck - Flowers<br />Clapper Loader: Rob Hawkins<br />Camera Trainee: Jack Plumbridge<br />Gaffer: Peter Bishop<br />Sparks: James Leech, Matt Simmons<br />Spark 1st Day - Simona Pran<br />Spark 2nd Day - Greg Probert<br />Lighting Trainee - Josh Wood<br />SFX Prosthetics Assistant - Jess Heath<br />SFX Prosthetics Trainee - Alice Platts<br />Art Department Assistants: James Middleton, Rupert Wilson<br />Stylist Assistant: Molly Robinson<br />Runners: Joe Coulson, Tara Sadeghi, Tom Stuart<br />Location Manager: Dean Whittaker<br /><br />Edit House: Cut + Run  <br />Edit Producer: Maggie McDermott<br />Edit Assistant: Rob McGuire<br />Post House: Black Kite<br />Post Producer: Polly Durance<br /><br />Commissioned by Natalia Maus
