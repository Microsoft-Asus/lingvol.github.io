On our way up to our Norcal property for some R&amp;R, Greg and I stop and make a surprise visit on Paula and Francis's 28th wedding anniversary! Francis set this up with me months ago as a gift for Paula. All in the household were respectful of social distancing and we all wore our masks. This is a gorgeous garden, tended by a very green thumb! Thanks to Paula for watching my videos and thanks to Francis for planning the surprise AND thanks to both for generously allowing me to film a TOD for all of you!
