Have you ever not washed your face before bed and awakened to a bunch of little pimples? Probably. Have you ever eaten a bunch of French fries, chocolate, or junk food and had your skin erupt in an epic breakout in the next day or two? Who hasn’t! The relationship between your skin and your body is symbiotic, mutually reliant, and interdependent. It’s important to realize that the foundation for healthy, radiant skin starts on the inside. Your skin is the largest and fastest-growing organ of your body and accounts for 6 to 10 percent of your body weight. All of your cells require good nutrition, proper hydration, oxygenation, and detoxification to thrive. What you put on your skin is just as important as what you put in your body. With this in mind, healthy skin can be achieved by making positive, well-considered choices in relation to your mind, body, and spirit. In addition to your skincare regimen, you want to pay attention to additional factors that can contribute to healthy skin, including: • Sun exposure • Eating habits • Hydration • Exercise • Environmental pollutants, and more … All of these factors combine with your genetic makeup and overall wellness to comprise the health of your skin. And while skincare products can help combat and correct some of the inherent issues and skin conditions, it is best to think of healthy skin holistically, as part of a completely healthy you. After all, a healthy you is a happy you. Keeping that in mind, let’s take a look at the simple things that make the recipes in this book decadent, healthy, and inspiring!<br /><br />#acne #blackheads#whiteheads, #Treatments #pimple
