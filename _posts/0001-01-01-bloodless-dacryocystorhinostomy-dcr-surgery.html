Well, almost bloodless!<br />Here are a few tricks that can be done to have a Bloodless DCR surgery:<br />1) A well-relaxed patient: A mild sedative on the day of surgery helps.<br />2) Blood pressure: Adequate control of blood pressure<br />3) Blood thinners: Stop all blood thinners 5 days prior, in consultation with Internist.<br />4) Good local anaesthesia (Xylocaine with adrenaline), even if you are performing it under GA<br />5) A slight head-up position during surgery helps prevent bleeding due to passive congestion.<br />6) Good nasal pack with Xylocaine and adrenaline; although I only use 3 Johnson buds.<br />7) Operating under surgical loupe magnification. This allows the visualization of fine blood vessels.<br />8) A good Monopolar and Bipolar cautery: Electrical, or Radiofrequency<br />9) Anatomy: There are specific locations where bleeding occurs: Orbicularis/Angular vessels/bony perforators/sac mucosa/nasal mucosa. Knowing these specific locations of bleeders will help you predict it and control it.<br />10) Blanching the nasal mucosa with Xylo+adrenaline injection just before the flap making (as shown in the video) helps relieve pain and allows bloodless flap.<br />11) Top up anaesthesia: Pain has to be controlled, to avoid the anxiety-induced rise in blood pressure. Use more local anaesthesia at specific points during surgery, or prefer GA (my personal choice).<br /><br />Thanks for watching.<br />Dr Milind Naik, MD
