Hey! Lots of folks are asking me about how to add a story to a publication on Medium. There are two steps. First, you have to be added as a writer. Second, once you've been added as a writer, you can submit.<br />This video walks you through both steps in less than 3 minutes.<br /><br />Why should you add your story to a publication? Pubs already have an existing audience. By putting your story in their publication, you get access to that audience which is a fantastic way to grow as a new author.<br /><br />Love my videos?
