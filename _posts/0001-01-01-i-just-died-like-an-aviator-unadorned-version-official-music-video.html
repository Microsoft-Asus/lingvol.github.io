I Just Died Like An Aviator (The Unadorned Version) is now available on Starlings Unadorned exclusively via Bandcamp right here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://matthewryan.bandcamp.com">https://matthewryan.bandcamp.com</a><br /><br />Starlings Unadorned is a collection of selected tracks from Hustle Up Starlings that were pared down and recorded in their purest &amp; starkest acoustic fashion. The collection is intended as a companion piece to the original versions that were beautifully produced by Brian Fallon and were performed, mixed and mastered by the greatest gang of friends a person could hope for. Starlings Unadorned also includes a handful of previously unreleased demos and songs. <br /><br />I hope you'll check it out. Grab a copy. And help spread word of its release.<br /><br />The video you see here was created by Charlotte Beatty, Chloe Barczak, Carina Begley and Gorman Bechard. And again, it acts as a companion to the original (I Just Died) Like An Aviator video that Gorman and the Girls made. <br /><br />You can view the original (I Just Died) Like An Aviator video right here if you're interested: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PlwrwVwFqw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PlwrwVwFqw</a><br /><br />Our hope is that together, the two videos offer an arc, a widening to the sense of story.<br /><br />It was Gorman's idea to do this. And Charlotte, Chloe and Carina brought it to vivid life. I am blown away by these young women. Their creativity and heart. They instill in me a hope for the future. So many young people do.<br /><br />And yeah, Gorman is pretty cool too. <br /><br />So here are the credits for the video:<br /><br />Directed, Edited &amp; Shot by Gorman Bechard<br /><br />Produced by Charlotte Beatty<br /><br />Starring:<br /><br />Chloe Barczak on Vocals<br />Carina Begley on Guitar<br /><br />Very Special Thanks to Dean Falcone &amp; Shellye Valauskas<br /><br />Gorman's done a lot of beautiful work.
