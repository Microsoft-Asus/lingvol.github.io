Informations about the things I've used:<br />Kraft Paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_paper">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_paper</a><br />Hemp Fabric: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp</a><br />(This Hemp fabric is come from H'Mong people in Vietnam, one not dyed, one dyed with nature Terminalia catappa leaves)<br />A steel wire (about 1mm thick) is 4 times the height of the notebook. You can find the details of how I bended the wire in the end of this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CL9PIjZF9Js">https://youtu.be/CL9PIjZF9Js</a><br /><br />Basic stitching techniques: https: / /youtu.be/XRfuHlR7ImM<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />I have started making notebooks like this since about the year 2010, when a sister gave me a paper punch tool. And much later I discovered that I can replace the papers inside, so I was able to write lots of papers with just one notebook. The old papers are then tied neatly or recycling.<br /><br />If you don't have Paper Punch tool, you can watch my next video about making Stitches Notebook with reusable cover (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tpC79FmXZbM)">https://youtu.be/tpC79FmXZbM)</a><br /><br />And like I always said, I hope you can use old clothes or fabric grown organic and dyed naturally.<br />Thank you<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />#RefillableNotebook #DinBooks #DinLife<br /><br />And specially thanks for Kevin MacLeod's music!<br /><br />Meditation Impromptu 01 by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100163">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100163</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>
