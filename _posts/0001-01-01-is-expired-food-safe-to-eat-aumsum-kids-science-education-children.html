{% raw %}Usually, we see three types of dates on food products. Sell-By, Best-By and Use-By. Use-By is what we call the expiry date. Consuming food past this date may prove to be harmful.<br /><br />Firstly, the nutritional value of the food will reduce. Secondly, as bacteria donâ€™t usually grow at low temperatures, many foods are frozen. But if foods are kept at room temperature, bacteria will develop in them. Now if consumed, they can cause vomiting, diarrhea, food poisoning, etc. Thirdly, it is believed that when canned food expires, the acids present in food react with the metal can and produce hydrogen gas, creating bulges in the can and thus, making the food unsafe to eat. <br /><br />So, expiry date is definitely a good indicator, but apart from that we should also rely on our senses of smell and sight to check the quality of the food.{% endraw %}
