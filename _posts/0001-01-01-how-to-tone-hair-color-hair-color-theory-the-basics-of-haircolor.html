Now more than ever Matt and his team at Gratitude Salon Education are showcasing their passion for education and for the salon industry by offering an on-line learning network at no charge.<br /> <br />&quot;A teacher of mine handed down videos to me in beauty school. The knowledge I had gained for free was amazing! The many artists and teachings in those videos inspired me to further my career and become an educator&quot; says Beck.<br /> <br />Now, almost ten years later, Matt has launched GratitudeEducation.com and Freesaloneducation.com. Two sites dedicated to providing the highest quality step by step education on a weekly basis for anyone who wants to log in, be inspired, and learn! Stylists can expect education on cutting, coloring, styling, barbering, and business tips. You can also look forward to totally free educational videos sent by email and live web classes broadcast from in the salon. This truly is a great affordable (obviously) investment that stylists can use to study at their own pace and convenience.
