Mark Usher’s funk-laden rhythm guitar attack punctuates the song while Megan’s silky smooth vocal delivery glide on top of the Bosq-crafted groove with an understated cool and sexiness that permeate the entire track.<br /><br />The featured vocalist on the flip of this double A-side disco burner is none other than soul-highness herself Nicole Willis, who was featured on Bosq’s previous single “Bad For Me”. Her powerful vocal style reminiscent of disco divas past along with Mark channeling his inner “Nile Rodgers” delivers yet another future dancefloor classic.{% endraw %}
