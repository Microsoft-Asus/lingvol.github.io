You might think you already know how the beliefs of a salesperson affect a sale. We’ve all heard about the power of positive thinking, and the importance of mindset in sales and persuasion. <br /><br />Does that mean you look in the mirror and tell yourself, “I should be closing more. I need to sell more. I am the top salesperson in my division”? Do you think such affirmations will give you a positive mental attitude?<br /><br />To be honest, that’s not really a great mindset for success. The best sales mindset doesn’t actually focus on sales at all. It focuses on value. Instead of thinking about how to get customers to buy what you’re selling, think about how you’ll improve their lives and circumstances. <br /><br />This is how the beliefs of a salesperson determine the outcome of a sale. Don’t keep your attention on what you can get from the customer – that’s just the way to sales sabotage, especially for a heart-centered entrepreneur.  <br /><br />Speaking of the importance of mindset in sales, here’s another example: If you believe that no one will buy your product because your prices are too high, your customers will sense that. And guess what? They won’t buy your product. Remember this – people are happy to pay a high price for something as long as it creates enough value for them. <br /><br />How much do you believe in your value? You can’t sell what you haven’t bought. Are you asking your customers to invest more in you than you’ve ever invested in yourself? If there’s a contradiction between what you've done and what you're asking your customer to do, your internal beliefs will block the sale. <br /><br />The beliefs of a salesperson matter in all sorts of ways. If we have integrity we will want to help the customer. We have to believe that the solution we offer creates enough value that people want it and will pay for it. And that’s the importance of mindset in sales.
