Climbing The Rostrum  Yosemite National Park 12-19-17<br /><br />Some 1,800 hundred feet above the valley floor is where you will find the Rostrum pinnacle. Located next to the Merced river on highway 140, it's hard to miss as you are driving into the Yosemite valley.<br /><br /> A few weeks back I had taken some photos for a climber who was climbing the Nose route on El Capitan. He mentioned to me a few days ago that he had some fixed ropes on the Rostrum and was working on some of the more difficult pitches/Alien. He wondered if I would like to come along to check it out and possibly snap a few pics as he was on the climb. I had always dreamed about standing on top of the Rostrum, and yesterday that dream came true! <br /><br />Thank you Erik Griffith for your expertise and patients guiding me down into the notch and then back up the Rostrum. What an incredible adventure that was for this old man, and the view, spectacular!   Ok,,, for those of you who have actually climbed the entire Rostrum route you must be laughing your ass off right about now. Keep in mind that this adventure was in the first few days of me getting back into climbing after 35 years off! hahaha... <br /><br />* Check out my other Rostrum clip where I am climbing out of the notch, not jugging. Fun jamming practice for a beginner like myself with an epic view.

Coming to the valley year after year photographing the different seasons, and by seeing the climbers up on the walls doing their thing, the urge to climb slowly started seeping back into my mind. I happened to be in the valley on my 60th birthday, and it was on that day that I went into the mountain shop and bought a rope, shoes, harness, Grigri, Microtrax and chock bag. With help from Youtube, and having met some amazing climbing friends here in the valley, I was able to relearn the basics and even some new techniques such as Top Rope Soloing. New for me that is. Super stoked to be back up on the rock climbing at age 62! <br /><br /><br />‚úÖ Subscribe to JMP Youtube and Click on the üõé to receive notifications when new videos are available.
