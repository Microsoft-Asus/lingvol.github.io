The key message to real estate agents is that thereâ€™s a much different timeline to comply with TRID--build extra time into your contracts.<br /><br />This is from a portion of a TRID Townhall that the American Land Title Association held on July 28. Participating in the townhall were Diane Evans NTP, ALTA president; vice president, Land Title Guarantee Co.; Dan Mennenoh, ALTA Board member; president, H.B. Wilkinson Title Co.; Bill Burding, ALTA Board member; EVP/general counsel, Orange Coast Title Co.; and Michelle Korsmo, ALTA chief executive officer.
