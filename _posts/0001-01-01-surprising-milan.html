#milan #milano #lombardy #visitmilan #aperitivo #italianfashion <br /><br />Ciao belli! <br />How are you?<br /><br />Today my exploration needs a slightly elegant approach as we are going to discover the Italian capital of Fashion and Design, Milano!<br /><br />I shaved, I went to my favorite hair-style “Del Monaco Hair Design” (Thank you Patrizia!), <br />I’m wearing a bow tie so I’m ready!<br /><br />What about you? <br />C’mon! Andiamo!<br /><br />Milan is a city of around 1,400.000 inhabitant plus many more in the metropolitan area.<br />It’s the financial capital of Italy, the center of Italian publishing and one of the most important trade fears of Europe with many interesting buildings and great museums.<br /><br />Apparently, it was founded ed by a Celtic tribe in the VI century BC.<br />Then it was conquered by the Romans who gave it the Latin name Mediolanum (from “Medio” that means in the middle and “Lanum” that means land as Milan is right in the middle of the Padanian plateau, the largest flat area of Italy.<br /><br />Thanks to a special law made by emperor Constantin in 313 AD. called the Edict of Milan, Christianity started to be tolerated in the Roman empire. <br /><br />• From 13th hundred was ruled by Visconti family, ducks of Milan<br />• Un the 15th hundred was under the Spanish rulers<br />• From 17th hundred was under the Austrians of the House of Hapsburg<br />• In 18th hundred was capital of the Italian Kingdom under Napoleon, and finally on of the most active place under the so called “Risorgimento, the political and social movement that unified Italy! <br /><br />Some people visiting Lombardy region -where we are now- skip Milan for the nearby lakes (Lake Maggiore, Lake Como, Lake Garda among others) or to go skiing by the Alps. <br />No, no, no! It’s a huge mistake as Milan got a lot to offer: if you have limited time you can focus on the city center were the main attractions are all close by.<br /><br />LA SCALA THEATER<br />Let’s start with one of the most prestigious Opera House in the world “La Scala” theater. <br />Here the 2 most iconic sopranos have performed: Renata Tebaldi and Maria Callas (they were bitter rivals, mamma mia!)<br />From outside it looks a bit humble so it could be disappointing if you expect something “grand” and opulent. Remember, the key word for Milan is “Understatement”.<br />Milanese are pretty discrete they don’t like to show off too much.<br />For your record, La Scala was built by architect Piermarini in 1778. <br />In 2002 it was completely renovated according to the project of Mario Botta, a great contemporary Swiss architect who added 2 new volumes to the preexisting building.<br /><br />The entire theater was carved like a Halloween Pumpkin, every single piece was finely restored and then put back in the right place.<br />Inside is fascinating. When they do not perform you can buy a ticket and visit it. <br /><br />LA GALLERìA ViTTORIO EMANUELE II (simply called “LA GALLERìA”)<br />It’s the oldest shopping mall of Italy and a great landmark as well as a place to see and to be seen!<br />It’s nicknamed “Il salotto di Milano” the drawing room of Milan.<br />Built at the end of 18th hundred by architect Giuseppe Mengoni at the time of this video it was recently restored and absolutely beautiful. <br /><br />The iron-glass roof is magnificent.<br /><br />On the ground there are 5 mosaics.<br />The central one portrays the coat of arms of the Savoy family, the former royal house of Italy while the others represent cotemporary and old capitals of Italy: Milano, Roma, Firenze e Torino. <br />A weird custom is linked with that one of Torino. The name of the city cams from “Toro” that means bull. Traditions says, if you spin around 3 times with your hell on the testicles of the poor bull (ouch!) this will bring good luck! <br /><br />Today “La Galleria” hosts luxury shops, haute couture, jewelry, restaurants and cafés.<br />Here is where the first Prada shop was established in 1913. Originally was called Prada Brothers and they produced luxury leather handbags and travel accessories.<br /><br />THE DUOMO<br />Drum rolls… for the most iconic building of Milan, the DUOMO, gothic style! <br />Goose bumps.<br />How you can skip Milan? Pazzi!<br />Started in 1386, sponsored by the lord of Milan Giangaleazzo Visconti who got the grand vision of the Cathedral. The project was made in Candoglian Marble from lake Maggiore and a new system of canal was built on purpose in order to bring the marble here in town by boat. <br /> <br />Inside it looks like a forest of pillars and statues, it’s incredible and deserve a guided tour.<br /><br />From the terrace you can have a breathtaking view of the city and you can see the famous Madonnina, the gilded copper statue of Mary that stands on the cathedral highest spire!<br />There is even a song dedicated to her…<br /><br />Remember! Whatever you go, hire a local guide! It’s the best way to discover highlights, landmarks and secret places!<br /><br />Enjoy the full video as there is a lot to see, for example of my favorite place for the “aperitivo”, the local happy hour!<br /><br />Un bacio!<br /><br />Sergio<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com">https://www.purple-planet.com</a>
