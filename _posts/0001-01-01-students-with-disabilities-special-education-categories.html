The different categories are broken down in the following categories: Autism, Deaf-blindness, deafness, developmental delay, emotionally disturbed, hearing impairment, intellectual disability, multiple disabilities, orthopedic disability, other-health impairment, traumatic brain injury, specific learning disability, speech language impairment, and visual impairments. Each of these fourteen different categories are clearly defined with the individuals with disabilities act, IDEA, in mind. The characteristics of students that have the following classifications are detailed for classroom teachers, parents of special education students, case managers, principals, advocates, general education teachers and more. The video also offers specific teaching strategies for each special education category. This video is part of a special education background knowledge playlist from Teachings in Education. The Teachings in Education channel is the complement to the Teachers Pay Teachers stores where resources for educators are sold.
