Faheem Badur, director of Peri’os (a franchise of grill restaurants) explained that in 2012 his business had got “a little bit adventurous” and launched a “fast-casual restaurant concept” based around “flavours of the world”, but confusion all round the den as Jenkins questioned “Am I investing in a restaurant supply business or am I investing in a restaurant chain?”<br />And the response provided by Faheem - “You’re investing in both.”<br /><br />An international sensation, Dragon's Den features entrepreneurs pitching for investment in the Den from our Dragons, five venture capitalists willing to invest their own money in exchange for equity.<br /><br />#DragonsDen #Confusion #WhatIsYourBusiness
