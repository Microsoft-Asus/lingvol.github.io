An orchestral arrangement of Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry's anthem I was glad when they said unto me with the additional 'Vivat' section. Originally composed for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. The Vivat Regina Elizabetha section is usually only included on royal occasions and has to be rewritten for every new monarch (Vivat Rex vivat ... for a King). This anthem will be heard all over the country in the coming month as we celebrate the Diamond Jubilee marking the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the throne.<br /><br />Sung by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge.<br />with the Cambridge University Musical Society Chorus, the Band of the Royal Military School of Music, and the New Philharmonia Orchestra
