Each year at Miss World the contestants are encouraged to partake in a charitable project which enriches the lives of others through hard work, selfless acts and fundraising. <br /><br />As varied as the contestants themselves, the projects are inspiring to behold, and are their 'Beauty with a Purpose'. Although there are many great projects, only one can be chosen as the winner of the Beauty with a Purpose Award, an accolade presented at the Miss World Final.<br /><br />More information on Beauty with a Purpose @ www.missworld.com/#/beauty_with_purpose
