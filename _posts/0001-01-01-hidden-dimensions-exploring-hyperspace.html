Extra dimensions of space—the idea that we are immersed in hyperspace—may be key to explaining the fundamental nature of the universe. Relativity introduced time as the fourth dimension, and Einstein’s subsequent work envisioned more dimensions still--but ultimately hit a dead end. Modern research has advanced the subject in ways he couldn’t have imagined. John Hockenberry joins Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, and other leading thinkers on a visual tour through wondrous spatial realms that may lie beyond the ones we experience.<br /><br />The World Science Festival gathers great minds in science and the arts to produce live and digital content that allows a broad general audience to engage with scientific discoveries. Our mission is to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by its wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.<br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube Channel for all the latest from WSF.<br />Visit our Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/">http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/worldsciencefestival">https://www.facebook.com/worldsciencefestival</a><br />Follow us on twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WorldSciFest">https://twitter.com/WorldSciFest</a><br /><br />Original Program date:June 5, 2010<br />MODERATOR: John Hockenberry<br />PARTICIPANTS: Escher String Quartet, Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, Linda Dalrymple Henderson, Shamit Kachru<br /><br />Brian Greene and a moment of physics. 0:29<br /><br />Einstein and what is gravity. 04:40<br /><br />Three dimensional space and the warps and curves of gravity. 06:33<br /><br />What does 3D space look like? 10:55<br /><br />Escher String Quartet. 16:34<br /><br />John Hockenberry Introduction. 21:22<br /><br />Participant Introductions. 24:17<br /><br />The history of multi-dimensions. 25:43<br /><br />Who preceded mathematician Kaluza. 31:14<br /><br />Whats the difference between math and physics 33:21<br /><br />Graviton's and quantum particles. 40:42<br /><br />Do experimental physicists except the math as truth? 45:45<br /><br />Quarks, Leptons and Forces. 53:10<br /><br />The Calabi-Yau manifold 55:34<br /><br />Einstein's lunar eclipse experiment. 01:00:00<br /><br />Describing the fourth dimension 01:05:56<br /><br />Will there be discoveries outside of just mathematics? 01:07:10<br /><br />Physics...
