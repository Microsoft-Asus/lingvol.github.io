Workplace health and safety (WHS) aims to ensure a safer working environment through generating awareness of hazards and the likely risks associated with them. It involves assessing and redesigning working environments in order to reduce the likelihood of harm occurring to workers, clients, subcontractors, or any person coming through a working area. The foundation documentation of health and safety in NSW is derived is the Workplace Health &amp; Safety Act 2011 (NSW). The Systems we develop must legally abide by recommended WHS Principals.
