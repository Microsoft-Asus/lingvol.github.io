Tamil Nadu has started the general counseling for MBBS/ BDS admission for the year 2020 on 23 Nov 2020. Unfortunately, due to Nivar Cyclone, no counseling could happen from 24 Nov to 29 Nov 2020. So, Day 2 counseling continued on  30 Nov 2020 with the allocation of seats from Open Category seats.<br />In this video, I have discussed the seats allotted on 30 Nov 2020, number of absentees and total seats allotted so far. I have also covered the closing rank for colleges where seats have closed for certain categories.<br />This video also forecasts the predicted safe score for various categories to get into Category A, that is government medical colleges.<br /><br />âœ¨ You can follow me on:<br />=====================<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/justgetmbbs">https://twitter.com/justgetmbbs</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/justgetmbbs">https://www.facebook.com/justgetmbbs</a><br />Web site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.justgetmbbs.in">https://www.justgetmbbs.in</a> | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.justgetmbbs.com">https://www.justgetmbbs.com</a> <br /><br />#justgetmbbs
