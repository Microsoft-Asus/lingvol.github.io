This lesson will define price discrimination, outline the conditions necessary for it to occur, and explain the different degrees of price discrimination. We will then illustrate the effect of perfect price discrimination and attempt to conclude whether or not it is good overall for society by looking at the effect it has on consumers and producers.<br /><br />Want to learn more about economics, or just be ready for an upcoming quiz, test or end of year exam?
