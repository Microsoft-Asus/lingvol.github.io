Welcome back to Hunt Fish Shoot. This week we bring you a concealed carry special, the Sig Sauer P365 XL. The Sig 365 XL is an excellent choice for a self defense firearm which can be easily concealed with close to full size pistol capacity. A great gun for any CCW carrier! Check it out!<br /><br />The Sig P365XL has a 3.7 inch barrel, X-ray night sights, extended beaver tail, one 12 round and 15 round magazine. The improvements you get over the standard P365 are well<br />worth it especially with the flat faced trigger. The trigger is the finer point of this pistol with a 90 degree break and crisp reset. <br /><br />If you are looking of a concealed carry pistol give the P365XL a hard look and you will be more than happy with it. A straight up competitor to the Glock 48 and it doesnâ€™t disappoint!<br /><br />Check back with us next time as we strive to bring you all exciting content encompassing the Hunt Fish Shoot lifestyle!
