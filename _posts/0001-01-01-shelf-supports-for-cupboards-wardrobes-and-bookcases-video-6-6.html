In today's video I will be showing you what shelf supports to use on your cupboards, wardrobes and bookcases. <br /><br />If you love my content and would like to send me a couple of Â£Â£ to help me to keep creating this free content click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/33krghd">http://bit.ly/33krghd</a> <br /><br />You can now access my ðŸ› Charlie DIYte Amazon Tool Store here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/charliediyte">https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/charliediyte</a> - where you'll find all my tried, tested and much loved DIY tools arranged into handy categories. <br /><br />I've used a number of shelf supports in the cupboards and wardrobes I've built around the house, from battens through to hidden shelf supports, so in today's video I thought I'd bring all this knowledge together into a bit of a DIY'ers guide.<br /><br />I will also be featuring bookcase strips in today's video.<br /><br />The conclusion - whilst the bookcase strips look slick and professional, they are most suited to bookcases rather than wardrobes and cupboards (funny that!) and to successfully install the strips you need a router, a double rebate cutter, multiple lengths of bookcase strips and all the clips to support the shelves. For the small sample I put together for today's video I spent a wapping Â£53. So compared to this, Â£7.14 for the hidden shelf supports featured in the video is an absolute bargain!   <br /><br />TODAY'S TOOLKIT<br />- Spirit level <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IOGmUK">https://amzn.to/2IOGmUK</a><br />- De Walt laser level <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2OW341t">https://amzn.to/2OW341t</a><br />- Shelf Supports - Hidden Nickel - 50 Pack <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xx9qLa">http://bit.ly/2xx9qLa</a> Â£7.14<br />- ION Flat Bookcase Strip 1829x19mm Electro Brass Plated <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xFz4fG">http://bit.ly/2xFz4fG</a>  Â£7.92<br />- ION Standard Flat Bookcase Clip - Electro Brass Plated - 10 Pack <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2QPVN1H">http://bit.ly/2QPVN1H</a> Â£1.86<br />- ION Heavy Duty Flat Bookcase Clip - Electro Brass Plated - 10 Pack <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xzV3ph">http://bit.ly/2xzV3ph</a> Â£3.96<br />- Double rebate cutter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xxLTd1">http://bit.ly/2xxLTd1</a> Â£29.54<br /><br />As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE - you can subscribe to my Channel here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/c/CharlieDIYte">http://www.youtube.com/c/CharlieDIYte</a><br /><br />LET'S CONNECT!<br />Charlie DIYte<br />-- Email: charliediyte@gmail.com<br />-- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/charliediyte">https://www.facebook.com/charliediyte</a><br />-- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://charliediyte.co.uk/">https://charliediyte.co.uk/</a><br />-- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/charliediyte/">https://www.instagram.com/charliediyte/</a><br />-- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CharlieDIYte">https://twitter.com/CharlieDIYte</a>
