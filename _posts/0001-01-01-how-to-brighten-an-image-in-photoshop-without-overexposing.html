An Amazing method to increasing the exposure in Photoshop CC, without letting it overexpose. In this video, we are going learn how to avoid and fix an overexposed photo in Photoshop especially while trying to enhance the brightness.<br /><br />Some image might seem dark and you naturally have the compulsion to increase the brightness, but while you do it, sometimes, certain parts of the image which are already bright, like face or eyes, begin to loose details, clip and overexpose. In this Photoshop tutorial, we are going to learn how to brighten the image and at the same time keep the already bright areas unaffected without manually painting and creating masks.<br /><br />We are going to achieve this using the new &quot;Blend If&quot; feature in Blending Options where we will learn to control the areas that we want to put the filter/effect on, in this case brightness, just with sliders.<br /><br />► Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/iaROYY">https://goo.gl/iaROYY</a><br /><br />If you think you can help, entertain or even disturb someone by sharing this channel's video.
