Organ of Little Waldingfield parish church, Suffolk    @ 1:07 Grave -- @ 3:29 Moderato    John Alcock was born in the shadow of St Paul's Cathedral, London, where he served as a chorister. When George II was crowned in Westminster Abbey in 1727, 12-year-old John Alcock marched in the procession, standing in for a chorister of the Chapel Royal who had died; the music was, of course, by Handel. Having held positions as organist in Reading and Plymouth, and applied in vain for the post at Salisbury Cathedral, in 1750 he became organist of Lichfield Cathedral. His experiences there are reflected in his semi-autobiographical novel, The Life of Miss Fanny Brown, published in 1760 under the pseudonym John Piper (PDF scan on IMSLP.com). Alcock clearly was a cantankerous if amusing character. The novel contains a 100-page chronicle of low-grade warfare between him and the cathedral choir, along with other anecdotes presumably culled from real life (&quot;a brisk looking Sailor, dress'd in a short Jacket and Trowzers, a very handsome India Handkerchief around his Neck, a neat Pair of Pumps, and a monstrous large Pair of Silver Buckles, with both Arms across, came into the Choir while the Absolution was reading; when looking around him, as if he was taking Survey of the Place and the People, at last the Organ struck up, at which the Jovial Tar began to skip about for near a Minute, and then capering backwards out of the Choir-Gate, halloo'd out, Merry be your Hearts, Old Boys&quot;) .<br /><br />Alcock paints himself as a conscientious musician continually stifled by the sloth and indifference surrounding him. Despite his rheumatism he punctiliously fulfilled his obligation &quot;always to play a voluntary after Morning and Evening Prayers, even in the severest cold when, very often, there was only one Vicar[-Choral?], who read [rather than sang?] the service, and an old woman at church beside the choristers....All the time I was organist…there was not a book in the organ-loft fit for use, but what I bought or wrote myself (for which I was never paid one halfpenny)&quot; (Six and Twenty Select Anthems…for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 Voices, Preface). &quot;All the time I WAS organist&quot;: in 1761 Alcock had enough of playing the cathedral organ and became organist of the parish churches of Tamworth and Sutton Coldfield. I am not clear what his formal status was now. A senior 18th-c. English organist often employed deputies. Being in charge of two churches (8 miles distant from each other and from Lichfield) meant that Alcock had to resort to this practice in any case; it seems that for his parish duties he used his sons. At the cathedral someone else now played the organ, but I do not know whether this person was paid by the chapter or by Alcock. It seems that Alcock stayed in his house in the cathedral close and died there in 1806, aged 90. He resigned his parish positions in 1786 and 1790 respectively. In his old age he attended services at the cathedral every day when in residence (he spent part of the year with his daughters in London; but was clearly in London often even in the 1750s). I do not know if he still performed any role at the cathedral.<br /><br />Alcock took a B.Mus. from Oxford in 1755 and a D.Mus. in 1766. The title page of his Ten Voluntaries of 1774 says &quot;for the Organ or Harpsichord&quot;, as it inevitably did with such collections in 18th-c. England, presumably to attract more buyers. But the very title of the individual voluntaries indicates the solo stop or stops to be used in the main movement, and the stops to be drawn are indicated throughout the score. No. 8, recorded here, is for &quot;Voix humain&quot; (Vox humana). I was going to use a sample set of a (neo-Baroque) instrument which actually has this stop, but then tried the piece on the Little Waldingfield organ and found that it sounded even better on this Georgian organ, Vox or no Vox. All pipework heard likely dates from 1809. The Stop Diapason on the Swell is now called Gedact but the pipes are Georgian, at least in the old part of the division which originally only went down to Tenor F (but no lower notes are needed for the solo part in this recording). It was probably when the Swell was made full compass in 1876 that the stop was relabelled.<br /><br />Alcock also published choral music and wrote glees, for which he won several prizes. He was buried in Lichfield Cathedral but I could not discover any monument to him. There is one to one John Savile, who died in 1803 hours after singing his last service as a vicar-choral of the cathedral, a post that he had held for 48 years. His epitaph is a poem which ends thus (the last line a quote from Samuel Johnson, himself a native of Lichfield): <br /><br />Now from that graceful form and beaming face<br />Insatiate worms the lingering likeness chase,<br />But thy pure Spirit fled from pains and fears<br />To sinless-changeless-everlasting Spheres.<br />Sleep then, pale mortal Frame, in yon low shrine<br />&quot;Till Angels wake thee with a note like thine.&quot;<br /><br />a_osiander(at)gmx.net / www.andreas-osiander.net
