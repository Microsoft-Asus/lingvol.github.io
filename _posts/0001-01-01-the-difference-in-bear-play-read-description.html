{% raw %}A question we get asked a great deal is if Jim and Susan ever get hurt accidentally while playing with the bears. The bears are VERY aware of the difference in size and strength. This is a great video that shows them playing gently with Jim and then the rougher play they do between each other. They are usually very careful not to play too rough with their humans. :)<br /><br />Please consider a donation to help us in our work! We canâ€™t do it without you!
