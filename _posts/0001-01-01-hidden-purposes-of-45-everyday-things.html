Common objects hide secret purposes not many people know about. Look around – even in the comfort of your own home – you’ve got plenty of new things to discover! Being surrounded by so many products and services nowadays, we might not even think that they have unexpected features. Sometimes we even use many things in the wrong way, even though the designers actually planned something different for their inventions. <br /><br />For example, the blue and red parts of the eraser aren’t for pen and pencil. The red side rubs the pencil particles out of the paper, while the blue side is stiffer and scrubs off a thin layer from the paper itself. Isn't it exciting when ordinary things turn out to be completely unusual? Let’s look at 45 everyday things that have a hidden purpose!<br /><br />#secrettricks #brightside #coolfacts<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />23 Ordinary Things With Unusual Hidden Uses <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktX2LqnDIB4&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktX2LqnDIB4&amp;</a><br />13 Secret Tricks Every Police Officer Uses <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jTQiJAor4Y&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jTQiJAor4Y&amp;</a><br />18 Things Designed for a Different Purpose <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cygWP_Tlf4&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cygWP_Tlf4&amp;</a><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
