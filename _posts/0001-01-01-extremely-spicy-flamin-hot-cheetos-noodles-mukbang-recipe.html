Step-by-step Recipe for How to make Hot Cheetos Noodles... Enjoy!<br />*GET A VIDEO FROM ME* <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cameo.com/nikocadoavocado">https://www.cameo.com/nikocadoavocado</a><br /><br />CAMEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cameo.com/nikocadoavocado">https://www.cameo.com/nikocadoavocado</a><br />(I make a person video just for you)<br /><br />Hey everybody. Today me and my husband Orlin Home are collabing and doing the Spicy noodle challenge but with a twist... we have Homemade Flamin' hot Cheetos Sauce for the pasta noodles. You can use either Instant Ramen Noodles (will taste better), dried Fettuccine Alfredo Noodles, or homemade spaghetti pasta. You will need many different ingreidents, so please pay attention. You will also need some spicy fire sauce or some nuclear fire sauce from the Korean fire noodle challenge. This will make it extra spicy. I'm using the Flamin' hot cheetos puffs. Enjoy the eating show!!!<br /><br />MERCH STORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/nikocadoavocado">https://teespring.com/stores/nikocadoavocado</a><br />PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/nikocadoavocado">https://patreon.com/nikocadoavocado</a><br /><br />• For Business Inquiries, please email: info@nikocadoavocado.com
