Resource Usage Map<br /><br />Here is a sneak peek at the feature which will be available from version 2021x.<br /><br />We are proud to present Resource Usage Map - a new web application that comes with Teamwork Cloud 2021x. Resource Usage Map allows you to create graphical representations of Teamwork Cloud project usages and this way detect potentially problematic usage areas. You can create usage maps for one or multiple resources, conveniently filter relevant project usages, search for resources in a large usage map, and view their details. It is especially helpful when you need to identify suspicious usages, such as cyclic or inconsistent project version usages.<br /><br />Filtering Resource Usages<br /><br />In the Resource Usage Map application, you can use the Filters pane to choose what types of usages should be displayed in a usage map. There are two filter groups: main filters allowing you to filter non-suspicious usages and standard profiles, and filters for suspicious usages which you can use to identify potentially problematic usages in a map.<br /><br />Identifying Suspicious Usages<br /><br />Resource Usage Map allows you to identify three types of suspicious usages:<br /><br />   - Inconsistent version usages;<br />   - Cyclic usages;<br />   - Unused resources.
