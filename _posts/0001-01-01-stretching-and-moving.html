Here is a video of me stretching on April 27th 2019! It was a stretching exercise that my dance teacher Kelli used to do when I took her class back when I was dancing. And then she did it with her class when I observed them recently, and it totally jogged my memory! And I was able to do a modified version of it today! My body felt so good afterwards!!! I'm so grateful that I'm able to start moving my body again.
