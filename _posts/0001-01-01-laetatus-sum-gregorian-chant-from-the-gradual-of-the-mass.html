{% raw %}This hymn is sometimes used in the Gradual of the Mass. The Latin lyrics and English translation follow: <br /><br />Laetatus sum in his, quae dicta sunt mihi: in domum Domini ibimus. <br />Fiat pax in virtute tua: et abundantia in turribus tuis.<br />Laetatus sum in his, quae dicta sunt mihi: in domum Domini ibimus. <br /><br />I rejoiced at the things that were said to me: we shall go into the house of the Lord. <br />Let peace by in Thy strength: and abundance in Thy towers.<br />I rejoiced at the things that were said to me: we shall go into the house of the Lord.{% endraw %}
