I have a friend who started recording herself reading bible scriptures and her prayers and that inspired me to create these guided christian meditation where I read aloud my favorite scriptures on different topics over peaceful music. I commonly use this recording in my morning meditation, as I drive to work, or when I'm trying to go to sleep. It also helps me memorize the scriptures over time just by listening to them over and over! I pray this helps you as well!<br /><br />// ABOUT POSITIVELY BRITT<br />Hi friend! I'm Brittany.
