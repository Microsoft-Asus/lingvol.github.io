But by far, the best thing to have in those situations is a guide — someone who already knows the way. When finding your way in life, God is the one promising to guide you, leading you by the Holy Spirit. In this message at Saddleback Church, Pastor Rick Warren discusses how to be led by God’s spirit and get his direction for your life. You’ll discover the 5 steps to receiving God’s guidance, leading you to have more peace and confidence in all your decisions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Connect with our online community by finding a small group, taking CLASS 101, or joining our Facebook group at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://saddleback.com/online">http://saddleback.com/online</a> or email online@saddleback.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Saddleback Church) (Rick Warren) (Pastor Rick Warren) (Living in the Goodness of God) (#LiveInGoodness) (Goodness of God) (God is Good) (Psalm 23) (Psalm 23 message) (Counter-cultural) (Led by the Holy Spirit) (What is the Holy Spirit) (How to be led by God) (God leads you in right paths) (Living in the Goodness of God) (Listen for God's response) (Holy Spirit is your guide) (Look to God's word) (God's will is in God's word) (Let God guide you) (What is my calling) (What am I called to do)
