Oh, the things you’d do if you could call the shots. Just a little more influence and power would go a long way, right? Depends on what kind of power you’re looking for. What’s the difference between human power and having God’s power in your life? <br /> ——<br /><br />God created us all for the purpose of relationship—and Eagle Brook is committed to helping bring people into relationship with God and with others. <br /><br />Eagle Brook Church is based in Minnesota, with multiple locations around the Twin Cities and Rochester. <br /><br />Stay Connected<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eaglebrookchurch.com/">https://eaglebrookchurch.com/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/eaglebrookchurch">https://www.facebook.com/eaglebrookchurch</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eaglebrookmn/">https://www.instagram.com/eaglebrookmn/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eaglebrookmn">https://twitter.com/eaglebrookmn</a><br /><br />#eaglebrookchurch
