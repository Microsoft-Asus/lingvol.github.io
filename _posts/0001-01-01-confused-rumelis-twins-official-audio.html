Confused, the debut single of Ben &amp; Noah, the Rumelis Twins, tells a real life story.<br />Everything about these Twins from a German town called Offenbach is real. When they decided to stir up the music market at the age of 15, they were only quietly smiled at. Two years went by and they conquered playlists in Europe, Asia and the USA with their vibes. Thousands of likes and followers on Instagram and TikTok included. <br />With guitar and piano, they messed around in their home studio trying to find their own sound. The two boys then decided to look for suitable producers with only one mission: to find a team that would let them be themselves and still give their vision the perfect and finishing touch. Together with the producer duo Neal &amp; Alex they created Confused. A surprising debut, which is everything, just not typically German.<br /><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/25sEYoQO1kfDSdYaX6DEqH?si=1zKfLLd1TyqJxbSDsYBREg">https://open.spotify.com/track/25sEYoQO1kfDSdYaX6DEqH?si=1zKfLLd1TyqJxbSDsYBREg</a> <br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/de/album/confused/1531616947?i=1531616950&amp;l=en">https://music.apple.com/de/album/confused/1531616947?i=1531616950&amp;l=en</a>   <br /><br /><br /><br />Instagram Rumelistwins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/rumelistwins?igshid=y1y2ro6yopdg">https://instagram.com/rumelistwins?igshid=y1y2ro6yopdg</a> <br /><br />Confused - Rumelis Twins<br />Prod/mix/master: by Neal and Alex<br />Master: Lex Barkey
