In this video Katharine Gray from friends1st Christian Dating Agency discusses Emotions and the part they play in dating. She discusses the importance of putting emotions to one side in the early days of meeting/dating someone - to enable the focus to be on the other person's characteristics. This is particularly important for Christians. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.friends1st.co.uk">https://www.friends1st.co.uk</a>
