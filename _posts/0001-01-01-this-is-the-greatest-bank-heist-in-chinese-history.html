It was getting dark.<br /><br />The vault manager of the Agricultural Bank of China was on edge. He was afraid. He felt something wasn’t quite right. Yes there were two security guards patrolling the grounds, which made him feel safer, but as vault manager he needed to be sure himself. <br /><br />He checked the printer room, the conference room, there was no one there, no sign of trouble. <br /><br />Then he entered the vault…<br /><br />…where everything was also fine; the money was there, the bank’s security system was down. In fact, everything was just as he planned. <br /><br />He started counting the money, but he knew he had to be quick, the paranoia was starting to get to him. He shoved the cash in his duffel bag, and swiftly left the vault. <br /><br />For Ren Xiaofeng, it was good to be the man in charge, it made robbing the Agricultural Bank of China that much easier. <br /><br />But he still had to be careful, he wasn’t out of the woods yet....
