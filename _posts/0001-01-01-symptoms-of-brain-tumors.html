Dr. Len Cerullo, CINN Medical Director and Neurosurgeon, discusses the most common signs and symptoms of brain tumors.  These symptoms are as variable as the parts of the brain where tumors may present.  Symptoms of brain tumors may include dizziness, weakness, seizures, behavior changes, headaches in rare cases and other neurologic deficits.  Dr. Cerullos experience spans over twenty-five years of treating patients with brain tumors at one of the largest and most comprehensive neurosurgical practices in the country.
