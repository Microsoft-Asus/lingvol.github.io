Until 3 years ago, Charlotte has lived an unconscious life where self-awareness wasn’t a part of her life, nor was this word part of her vocabulary. She decided to do something about it and became the captain of her own life, and has experienced on herself what it means to be self-aware, and how it can change a person’s life by simply being aware of how you think, what you say and how you perceive the outer as well as the inner world. She will share her ideas on the importance of self-awareness teaching in the education for children and teenagers, and how it may very much likely be life-changing. “Self awareness can change your life”<br /><br />Charlotte is an international speaker and a teen &amp; family coach who helps young people achieve great self esteem and give them strength and power from within to be able to face challenges in life.
