I love boating. I want you to do the same. But boating is not for everyone, and I will give you 5 good reasons to not get a boat.<br /><br />After going on about all the challenges of boating I will share with you 4 of the main reasons why I still own a boat, and why I enjoy it so damn much.<br /><br />I'm not trying to scare you from buying a boat, just making you think if you want it bad enough. If you watch the second half of the video you'll see why I can't wait to go boating.<br /><br />Top 5 reasons to NOT buy a boat:<br />1. Time: Using and caring for your boat will take A LOT of time!<br />2. Cost: Boating is insanely expensive. Parts, marina fees, depreciation ... do I even need to continue?<br />3. Worries: You're always gonna worry when there's a big storm on the way or if the ocean is freezing solid.<br />4. Boat Handling: Fresh boat owner + full marina + a bit of wind = a challenge. Are you up for it?<br />5. Committment: Is your partner or your family onboard with your boating plans? Spending so much time and money you'd better be committing to it.
