How Much? &amp; How many? We use how much for uncountable nouns and we use how many for countable nouns. All the examples are with food. We will practice both questions and answers to help you fully understand these two grammar patterns. Each pattern is illustrated for better understanding. Each sentence is color coded so that you can understand the structure of these patterns. In the second part of this video you will be able to practice on your own to build your English speaking and fluency skills. <br /><br />‚è±TimeStamps‚è±<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:17 How Much?<br />1:07 How Many?<br />1:56 Quiz / Review<br /><br />Language in use:<br />How much milk do you want?
