The LED F160 has one of the widest ranges of optional attachments and light shapers out there. This feature will give you more freedom to shoot unique videos and photographs. <br /><br />Still Moving, a fresh creative agency in the UK, used the LED F160 for multiple video shots. For this sequence, they hooked the lamp to a movable boom arm which enabled them to follow the speed of the dancer while trying out several light shapers. With the freedom of creativity and versatility that the LED F160 offers, they created this astonishing video sequence. <br /><br />Discover more about the LED F160’s performance for videos and photography:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2r73GHn">https://bit.ly/2r73GHn</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Connect with Still Moving: <br />www.instagram.com/stillmovingmedia<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StillMovingMedia/">https://www.facebook.com/StillMovingMedia/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stillmovingmedia.co.uk">https://www.stillmovingmedia.co.uk</a> <br /><br />Connect with broncolor:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/broncolor/">https://www.instagram.com/broncolor/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/broncolor">https://www.facebook.com/broncolor</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.broncolor.swiss">https://www.broncolor.swiss</a>
