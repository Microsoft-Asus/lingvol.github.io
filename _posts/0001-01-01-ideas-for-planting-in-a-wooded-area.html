I can't believe the weather in my Ohio today.  The ground isen't frozen and I'm able to enjoy a walk out along my woodline to share some of my conifer growing adventures.  <br /><br />It's time to get your order in if you are in Wood County, Ohio.  The Wood SOil and Water Conservation District 2017 Tree, Shrub and wildflower packet orders are due by February 28.  <br /><br />I'm hoping after sharing how successful growing these trees from the conservation district has been that you may be inspired to order some to grow in your garden. <br /><br />More about my #treeproject at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brenhaas.com/tree-project-2015/">https://brenhaas.com/tree-project-2015/</a><br />Video on YouTube at : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XYBBC-LvLUQ">https://youtu.be/XYBBC-LvLUQ</a>
