{% raw %}Hey there, #Ranger_Squad!<br /><br />Lillian Deidamia's suffering is about to end within her little nightmare. But... was it just a dream or was it all real? Will she end the suffering that she is going through? That is the question?<br /><br />WARNING: There are going to be some flashes in the video that may disturb you, Ranger Squad. Viewer discretion is advised.<br /><br />#GachaClub #GCMV #GachaLife<br /><br />Audio Used: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2isEHCCnng">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2isEHCCnng</a><br /><br />Part 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHSlDSj2QIM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHSlDSj2QIM</a><br /><br />Lyrics<br /><br />At a deserted station<br />where the railroad tracks are likely to brake<br />With the loud railroad,<br />Whose trains are about to collapse<br />I swallowed the damp warm air<br />And started to move<br /><br />Once again I'll wonder if I prefer it this way<br />Within a Dream, I shut my mouth<br />At this rate if that is still the case,<br />My eyes opens, always to that track<br /><br />Since I must awaken from this dream once more,<br />And thereby not arrive at that station<br />My body heat mingles with the chilliness,<br />Still here I must abandon that station<br />The face of a monkey has come to meet me<br />At that time what I saw was the same<br /><br />It will be my turn next,<br />The shadow tramples over a circle intoxicated<br />It would seem I can't go home,<br />There is no more escaping from here<br /><br />Once again I'll wonder if I prefer it this way,<br />Within a Dream, I can't see anything<br />At this rate if that is still the case<br />My eyes open, always to that track<br />There is no escaping my turn next,<br />I never wish to come to this place again<br />Because of that, I am fearful<br />I close my eyes and this place is no more<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Remember to leave a like, a comment, and subscribe to become part of the Ranger Squad!<br /><br />Got any questions?
