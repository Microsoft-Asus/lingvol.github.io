This is a video from my recent 24-hour stopover flight with Qatar Airways in Doha, Qatar. <br /><br />You can spend your time at Hamad International airport or you could extend your flight and turn your trip into a layover. <br /><br />Qatar has a tourist visa-free entry for over 80 countries. <br /><br />Qatar Airways has many flights connecting Doha with the world. <br /><br />If you wish to stopover you can book an affordable hotel in advance on the Discover Qatar website with your flight booking.<br /><br />Break up your flight, explore Doha for 24 hours, get some rest and enjoy a nights stay then fly to your final onwards destination. <br /><br />Why not explore Doha, Qatar, break up your journey and enjoy an extra destination. <br /><br />I hope you like my video with all the attractions I visited during my short stopover: <br /><br />- Westin Doha Hotel <br />- Hamad International airport <br />- Qatar Airways <br />- Get a 24-hour bus ticket from the airport to explore Doha. <br />- Qatar National Museum  <br />- Take a Dhow trip. <br />- The Pearl monument<br />- Museum of Islamic Art <br />- Enjoy the Doha skyline at night <br />- Souk Waqif <br /><br />Have a great time exploring Doha, Qatar!
