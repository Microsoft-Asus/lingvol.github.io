This procedure exposes the brain to remove tumors. Brain tumors pose a serious challenge for surgeons. So how do we access this tumor, without injuring the adjacent healthy brain? Craniotomy is the answer. The procedure allows surgeons to access the tumor through the skull. <br /><br />Tech Insider tells you all you need to know about tech: gadgets, how-to's, gaming, science, digital culture, and more. <br />Subscribe to our channel and visit us at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sai">http://www.businessinsider.com/sai</a><br />TI on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/techinsider">https://www.facebook.com/techinsider</a><br />TI on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/">https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/</a><br />TI on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/techinsider">https://twitter.com/techinsider</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Following is the transcript of the video:<br /><br />Here's how the procedure works.<br /><br />The surgeon makes an incision in the skin over the skull. They'll often use MRI or CT scans to determine exactly where to cut. Next, they drill small holes and lift a section of skull called a bone flap. That exposes a protective layer called the dura.  The neurosurgeon inserts a small microscope. Then they can safely remove the tumor. Finally, they replace the bone flap and screw it in place. The procedure might be finished, but the work is far from over. <br /><br />Complications can include; infection, seizures, swelling of brain tissue.<br /><br />Even after a successful surgery, patients can experience neurological issues.  <br /><br />We have to make sure that the patient [is] continuously training the function and sometimes even relearn[ing[ these things, which might have been lost during surgery.<br /><br />It is very rewarding if you go back to the patients and you see that everything which has been discussed has been achieved. And the patient regains hope for his future life. And we were able to deliver all the excellent care we were talking about. Craniotomy has many uses beyond aiding in tumor removal. It's also used to treat aneurysms, abscesses, and epilepsy. Craniotomy can also help relieve brain pressure caused by injury.
