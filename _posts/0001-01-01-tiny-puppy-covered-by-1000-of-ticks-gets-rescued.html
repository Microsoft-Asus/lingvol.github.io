Only weeks old, he survived a life-saving blood transfusion and fought to overcome a slim chance to survive.<br />Today.... he's adopted, happy, and thriving as he continues to grow at now 35 pounds!  :)<br /><br /><br />Other Sources:<br />The dodo pet rescue: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDodoSite">https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDodoSite</a><br />Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/eldad75">https://www.youtube.com/user/eldad75</a><br /><br /><br />For copyright issues, please contact us by email at dogrescuetm@gmail.com for credit editing or for removing clips/videos.
