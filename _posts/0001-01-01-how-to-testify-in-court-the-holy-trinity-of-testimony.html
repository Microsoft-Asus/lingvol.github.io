Testifying should be simple. Too many get it wrong too often. Undoing a bad answer is like putting toothpaste back in the tube. Try as you might, it ain't happening. The key is understanding your role and surrendering to the process.<br /><br />Visit my Blog to learn all my DOs and DON'Ts of testifying (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://craigpenney.com/Blog-Toronto-Criminal-Lawyer-Do-Dont-Testifying.html).">http://craigpenney.com/Blog-Toronto-Criminal-Lawyer-Do-Dont-Testifying.html).</a> Read the reactions of Judges from Court transcripts. <br /><br />&quot;How&quot; you testify is just as important as what you have to say.
