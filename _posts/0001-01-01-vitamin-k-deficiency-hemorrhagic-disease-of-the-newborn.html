{% raw %}Vitamin K Deficiency | Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn or Vitamin K dependent bleeding (VKDB) is a bleeding disorder that occurs due to deficiency of vitamin K.<br /><br />Factor XIII Deficiency | Fibrin Stabilizing Factor Defect.<br /><br />Factor X Deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease. In factor X deficiency, there is a coagulation (secondary Hemostasis) defect.<br /><br />In a previous video: we discussed &quot;hemophilia A, Hemophilia B, and Hemophilia C | A Comparison.&quot;<br /><br />‚ñ∫  üíä My Antibioitcs course is on sale...Use the discount code: ANTIBIOTICS25 at checkout to get a 25% discount: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.medicosisperfectionalis.com/products/courses/antibiotics/">https://www.medicosisperfectionalis.com/products/courses/antibiotics/</a><br /><br />Hemophilia is a genetic Coagulation Disorder characterized by abnormally excessive bleeding ü©∏ even after a minor scratch.

Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are X-linked recessive, whereas hemophilia C is autosomal recessive.'<br /><br />Coagulation Tests (PT, aPTT, TT, Fibrinogen, Mixing Studies,..etc).<br />The coagulation factors are divided into 3 coagulation groups | Fibrinogen group, Prothrombin group, and Contact Group..<br /><br />üòçüñºAnimated Mnemonics (Picmonic): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.picmonic.com/viphookup/medicosis/">https://www.picmonic.com/viphookup/medicosis/</a> <br /><br />- With Picmonic, get your life back by studying less and remembering more.
