This short film examines some possible policy responses to the shortage of affordable housing supply in the UK. It argues that a large increase in house building is needed, much of which should be new dwellings that are affordable to rent by households on low incomes. It explains the use in other countries of policies that link initiatives to increase housing production, ensure that housing is of good quality and affordable and is allocated to those in need of decent housing. It argues that policy changes are needed in the UK and suggests new ways to promote an increase in the supply of affordable housing.<br />The film builds on more than twenty five years of evidence-based housing and planning policy research at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research. It has been supported by an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account award and has been used to provoke debate and inspire new ways of thinking about housing policy. It has been shown at events in Cambridge and London attended by politicians, civil servants and housing professionals.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=cambridgeuniversity">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=cambridgeuniversity</a>
