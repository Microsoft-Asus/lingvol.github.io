This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Adventure is a mindset accessible to every pocketbook. Though often seen as an “escape” for those with money &amp; time, Ginger Kern believes travel is not just about exploring other countries. She knew how it felt to be bold and adventurous abroad and wanted to avoid the trap of coming home and playing it safe with old routines. <br /><br /><br /><br />With three simple questions, she found a way for anyone to stay in the traveler’s mindset and live a life of adventure, no matter where they are in the world.<br /><br />Ginger Kern is a Fulbright alumna and a Global Shaper as part of the World Economic Forum. Originally from the Midwest, she left the U.S. to work in Europe for three years, traveling to 25 countries around the world by the age of 25. Through her online platform, Traveler’s Mindset, and through speaking across the U.S., she works to encourage a culture of openness, curiosity and adventure.<br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
