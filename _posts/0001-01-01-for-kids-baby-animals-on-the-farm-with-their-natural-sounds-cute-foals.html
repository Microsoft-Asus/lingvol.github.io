Especially for small children, I made &quot;BABY ANIMALS ON THE FARM&quot; without any music, so that they can experience the animals with their natural sounds. From the young alpaca foal to a sweet drift of piglets, many young animals can be seen in this video.<br />Various rare breeds are seen in this video:<br />Sprinzen cattle,<br />Mangalica pig,<br />White Baroque donkey,<br />Orpington chicken,<br />Tux-Zillertal cattle,<br />Valais Blackneck goat,<br />Whitecrested Polish chicken,<br />Proveis-Ultental chicken,<br /><br />Robert Höck, October 2018
