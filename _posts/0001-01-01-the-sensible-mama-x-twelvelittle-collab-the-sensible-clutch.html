{% raw %}**Note: all of my videos are created for, and directed toward, an adult audience. My channel, Perpetual Mommy, DOES NOT make YouTube content geared toward, nor intended to be watched by, minors. Again, this video is not intended for children.**<br /><br />It is here!!! The Sensible Clutch is the amazing result of the collaboration efforts of my dear friend Amber (Founder and CEO of The Sensible Mama) and Julia (Founder of TWELVElittle). When two bright, motivated, and successful women work together to create a new product the end result can be nothing short of fabulous, and The Sensible Clutch just further proves this theory-- I am so very proud of both Amber and Julia- exceptional job, Ladies!
