There was crochet slipper boots tutorial on my chanel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX6QVQz41fo&amp;t=831s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX6QVQz41fo&amp;t=831s</a> but it was without voice instructions (as all of my videos are). Some of you asked me to do more clear video, with slow speed and voice instructions. So, here is step by step video tutorial for the same slipper boots. This tutorial is for experienced beginners. <br /><br />Old video was 26 minutes long, this video is more than 1 hour. I filmed the whole process, without speeding up and without cutting out some steps. Hope this will help new crocheters to make their slippers. <br /><br />The slippers are made in two separate pieces - the upper and the sole.<br />This is not my pattern. I found the written pattern here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.smpcraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/slipper-boots.pdf">http://www.smpcraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/slipper-boots.pdf</a><br /> <br />Size: Sole of this slipper measures 24-25 cm long. It fits 38-40 size, it's USA size 8<br /><br />How to adjust the size: first chain  is circumference of open section. By adding rounds you add height of your slipper. Then comes instep part, by adding stitches, you add width. By adding more rows you add length to hole slipper. Measure your foot in different places and adjust the size by adding and removing stitches, rounds and rows. <br /><br />You can also make smaller slippers by using medium yarn and 4 mm crochet hook.<br /><br />You can watch video tutorial for 0-3 month size slippers:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt1PeiRfeQE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt1PeiRfeQE</a><br /><br />Stitches used: sc - single crochet, <br />                       slip stitch<br />                       ch - chain <br />                       dec (decrease) - single crochet 2 together<br /><br />You will need: 2 ball bulky weight yarn (200 g)<br />                        6 mm crochet hook<br />Gauge: 10 stitches and 14 rows = 10 cm<br /><br />facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/turtle.whicky.crochet/">https://www.facebook.com/turtle.whicky.crochet/</a>
