{% raw %}A century-old time capsule, filled by long-gone Wall Street businessmen as been unsealed revealing a range of items, which document New York as a historic commercial hub at the time. <br /><br />Spectators at the New-York Historical Society gathered around the mysterious bronze box as workers wearing surgical gloves removed 26 screws keeping it sealed since 1914. <br /><br />Historian Nick Yablon removed the first of the items: a collection of documents and news reports depicting the New York businessmen's interests, from the pioneering tea, coffee and spice trade of the 17th century Dutch colony to contemporary baseball and bullfights. <br /><br />Inside there was also a message into the future as Mr Yablon explained: <br /><br />&quot;There's also a telegram from the governor of New York which is partly addressed to the time capsule organiser, but also to the future governor of New York in 1974.&quot;<br /><br />The Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association who deposited the box with the historical society had asked that it be unsealed in 1974, but somehow, it was forgotten. <br /><br />A curator discovered it in the society's warehouse in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. <br /><br />Get the latest headlines <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to The Telegraph <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv</a><br /><br />Like us on Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk">http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk</a><br />Follow us on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/telegraph">https://twitter.com/telegraph</a><br />Follow us on Google+ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/">https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/</a><br /><br />Telegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.{% endraw %}
