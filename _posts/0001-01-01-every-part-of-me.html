{% raw %}Contrary to what many say and feel, Jesus Christ is full of love and forgiveness, even for the worst of us. It would't take long to dig up something on me that I'd be ashamed of, but it would be the very reason I could tell you how loving, merciful and forgiving Jesus really is. He is real, and He will never leave or forsake those who turn to Him. It doesn't matter who you are, or what you've done, if there's hope for a sinner like me, there's hope for you. Open your heart to Him.{% endraw %}
