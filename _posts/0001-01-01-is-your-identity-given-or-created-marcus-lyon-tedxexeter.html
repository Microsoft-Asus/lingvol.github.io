{% raw %}Who are we? Marcus asks us to question how our identities are formed. Using Somos Brasil (We are Brazil), a multi media photography, sound and DNA project, he brings us images, stories and ancestral DNA to examine modern Brazilian identity. In turn he asks us to consider what drives us and what we can become.<br />--<br />At TEDxExeter 2016 our speakers encapsulated the idea of movement, that grappling with humanity’s toughest questions requires first a vision, a dream, and then action.<br /><br />Video Production Chromatrope (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chromatrope.co.uk/)">http://chromatrope.co.uk/)</a><br />Production Manager Andy Robertson (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/familygamertv)">http://www.youtube.com/familygamertv)</a><br /><br />Marcus Lyon is a British artist. He began his career with Amnesty International and The International Children’s Trust photographing street children in Latin America, Africa and Asia. He has an international reputation as a conceptual landscape and portraiture artist and has photographed notable public figures including the last four British Prime Ministers and Queen Elizabeth II. His most recent bodies of work on urban expansion, Brazilian national identity, mass migration and modern dance have been shown globally.<br /><br />Marcus is also a committed social entrepreneur. He currently serves on the boards of Somerset House and Leader’s Quest, and is a founder ambassador for The Consortium for Street Children, Photovoice, BLESMA and Home Start.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
