{% raw %}Autoglym Pure Shampoo has been designed for use on matte or satin finish cars. Its high foaming formula works well with both warm and cold water. The effects i saw from this were very positive and it has a snow foam texture to it. Our featured car today is the Stunning Mercedes Benz GTR AMG in Matte Grey. This car had Matte Black Alloys so it restricts the amount of wheel cleaning chemicals i can actually use so i found by using a bucket on pure shampoo and some well soaked soft brushes i was able to maintain these wheels quite easily without doing any harm to the finish.<br /><br />In a later video we will test out Pure Shampoo Vs Autoglym Shampoo Conditioner to see which is best on everyday paintwork. <br /><br />#detailing #autoglym #shampoo<br /><br />Below are some my favourite Car Shampoo's on the Market. <br /><br />Pure Shampoo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vYCI7A">https://amzn.to/2vYCI7A</a> <br />Autoglym - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VTpi7o">https://amzn.to/2VTpi7o</a> <br />Autoglym Shampoo &amp; Conditioner - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39sdehp">https://amzn.to/39sdehp</a> <br />Carplan Ultra Shampoo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32Tw7aK">https://amzn.to/32Tw7aK</a> <br />Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 1.89L Biodegradable Formula <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2QaDJAq">https://amzn.to/2QaDJAq</a> <br />Meguiars Ultimate car wash <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2viZpTL">https://amzn.to/2viZpTL</a><br /><br />Autoglym Super Resin Polish <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38JFk33qTQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38JFk33qTQ</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />Due to factors out of control of The Car Valeting Channel, David Walker, we cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this videos information.This Car Valeting Channel assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.
