{% raw %}Hi guys! Help me reach my goal of 2,000 subscribers and click that subscribe button! <br />Juliann, my mom, and I all drove up to my college town to drop off half of my dorm stuff early. We had to do this because of COVID-19, but it gave us an excuse to go shopping. The room is very nice, but unexpectedly I got an email saying that we have to move to a different dorm because that hall is going to be used for isolation... We love 2020 am I right? Anyway hope you all enjoy the video!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do not own any of the music in this video<br /><br />SUPPORT ME BY CLICKING HERE : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/kaitysmith">https://www.patreon.com/kaitysmith</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON MY SOCIALS<br />Instagram: @thatkaitysmith<br />Twitter: @kaitsmith543<br />Pinterest: @kaityrox543<br />kaitlynnsmith543@gmail.com{% endraw %}
