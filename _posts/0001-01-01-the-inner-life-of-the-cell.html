Harvard University selected XVIVO to develop an animation that would take their cellular biology students on a journey through the microscopic world of a cell, illustrating mechanisms that allow a white blood cell to sense its surroundings and respond to an external stimulus. This award winning piece was the first topic in a series of animations XVIVO is creating for Harvard's educational website BioVisions at Harvard.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.xvivo.net">http://www.xvivo.net</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://multimedia.mcb.harvard.edu/">http://multimedia.mcb.harvard.edu/</a>
