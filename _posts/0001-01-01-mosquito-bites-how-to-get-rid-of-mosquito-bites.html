{% raw %}Mosquito Bites or Mosquitoes. How To Get Rid Of Mosquito Bites. How To Get Rid Of Mosquitoes. Repellent. Remedies.<br /><br />One of my favourite notifications is your comments and as you may already know more often than not I'll get back to you with a reply and heart. If you'd like more information on any of the questions I've answered or have a question, then let me know so I can try and either dedicate a video to it or get back to you in next months responding to your comments.<br /><br />Here are the chapters to the video,<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:43 Why Do Mosquitoes Bite You<br />02:16 What Are The Symptoms Of Mosquito Bites<br />02:36 How To Get Rid Of Mosquito Bites<br />07:12 When To Speak To Your Healthcare Professional<br />08:15 How To Prevent Mosquito Bites<br />12:29 Conclusion<br /><br />MOSQUITO BITES:<br />Mosquitoes are the world’s deadliest animal – they are responsible for millions of bites and deaths every single year – in this video I’m going to give you five tips to treat mosquito bites AND five tips on how to prevent them. You might catch some bonus tips along the way too so let’s get started!<br /><br />HOW TO GET RID OF MOSQUITO BITES:<br />Of course sometimes it’s inevitable that you will get bitten! You might experience itchiness, raised red skin, inflammation or swelling of the bite and sometimes liquid weeping out of the bite. I go into detail on treatments at 02:36 in the video.<br /><br />INSECT REPELLENTS:<br />As explained in the video here are a list of other insect repellents with the most effective at the top:<br />1- DEET 50%<br />2- Picaridin 20%<br />3- Lemon eucalyptus (PMD) 30%<br />4- IR3535 20% (NOT effective in malarial areas)<br /><br />WHEN TO GET MEDICAL ADVICE:<br />Contact your GP, Pharmacist or call NHS 111 for advice if,<br /><br />• You're worried about a bite or sting.<br />• Your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse.<br />• You've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes<br />a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen.<br />• You have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness.<br />• You have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms.<br /><br />There is one serious red flag I must tell you about. If you experience any flu-like symptoms, such as a fever or aches and pains, within 12 months of visiting a high-risk area for malaria or yellow fever you must talk to your GP or Pharmacist for further advice.<br /><br />Mosquitoes can carry other diseases too like Dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika virus and Chikungunya. You should always mention if you have been travelling abroad when describing your symptoms to your GP or Pharmacist so they can do their best to help you.<br /><br />OTHER INSECT BITES:<br />Last summer I also made another video on common insect bites. In the video I discuss how to spot them, how to treat them and when to get medical attention.
