This organization exists. And it has a name with which you are very familiar. It calls itself “Planned Parenthood,” and the deception begins right there. Planned Parenthood doesn’t help people plan for parenthood; it helps people escape it.<br /><br />And that’s only the start of its deceptions.<br /><br />Planned Parenthood tells you it’s one of the nation’s “leading women’s health care providers,” but it provides very little healthcare.<br /><br />It tells you it provides adoption referrals, but the only adoption advice it is likely to offer is, “Google it.”<br /><br />Most deceptive of all, Planned Parenthood tells you that abortions are a small part of what it does, but it performs more abortions than anyone else in America.<br /><br />Here are the facts.<br /><br />The folks who run Planned Parenthood boast that they provide life-saving cancer screenings. And they do. Just not that many of them – less than 2% of the nation’s screenings each year.<br /><br />They talk about providing breast exams.  They do, but just not that many of them—again, less 2% of the nation’s total.<br /><br />They talk about providing ultrasounds, but the last thing they want to do is show a pregnant woman an image of her growing child. So, they don’t. The ultrasound is only for Planned Parenthood’s use—to better facilitate patients’ abortions.<br /><br />In other words, abortion – not women’s health – is Planned Parenthood’s reason for being.<br /><br />Every year it does more than a third of all abortions in America—over 321,000 of them. That’s equivalent to every inhabitant of St. Louis or Pittsburgh – wiped out, every year. That’s over 880 abortions every day. An abortion every 98 seconds.<br /><br />And while the number of total abortions in the United States is going down, Planned Parenthood’s market share of abortions has increased from 23% in 2006 to 34% in 2016.<br /><br />So, when Planned Parenthood says it’s devoted to women’s reproductive rights, what it means is it’s devoted to aborting as many babies as possible.<br /><br />And here’s the biggest deception of them all: Planned Parenthood would like you to believe that abortion is only 3% of the total services they provide.<br /><br />Three percent. Doesn’t sound like very much, does it?<br /><br />But here’s how they get to that 3%: They count every “discrete clinical interaction” as its own service. What is a “discrete clinical interaction”? Pretty much anything you do from the moment you walk into one of their clinics.<br /><br />I’ll give you an example. Let’s say a woman comes into Planned Parenthood for one service—an abortion. Before providing an abortion, Planned Parenthood has to confirm that the woman is pregnant, right? So, they administer another service—a pregnancy test. That’s two services! Then, after the abortion, on your way out the door, they hand you a prescription. That’s three services!<br /><br />And there are many other services provided during the abortion process that Planned Parenthood claims as “discrete clinical interactions.”<br /><br />For the complete script, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.prageru.com/videos/what-you-need-know-about-planned-parenthood">https://www.prageru.com/videos/what-you-need-know-about-planned-parenthood</a>
