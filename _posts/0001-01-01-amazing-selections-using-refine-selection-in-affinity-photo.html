{% raw %}Affinity Photo selection tools are good but sometimes you need something more powerful. That’s where the Affinity Refine Selection tools can help.<br /><br />In this video I demonstrate how to use Affinity’s Refine Selection to improve the accuracy of a complex selection. Using these tools, you can quickly and easily make complex selections with a high degree of precision. And if you’re a Photoshop user, it’s still worth watching the video because Photoshop has the same tools.<br /><br />This video is a follow on from my previous video where I demonstrate using Affinity Quick Mask to refine selections: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MVOLUabp_yI">https://youtu.be/MVOLUabp_yI</a><br /><br />Both videos are topics covered in  my forthcoming book “Affinity Photo How To” which launches January 2021.
