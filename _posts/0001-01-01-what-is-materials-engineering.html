Materials engineers will cover the 4 main classes of materials in college including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites.<br /><br />Materials engineers can find careers in the aerospace, biomedical, automotive, electronics, and manufacturing sector just to name a few. However, this discipline covers a wide range of sectors and careers because basically everything we use is made out of some material that needs to be optimized.<br /><br />Note that we can classify materials science and materials engineering as two different fields, but in college (at least in undergrad), your school will likely call it one or the other (or maybe 'materials science and engineering') and you will be in the college of engineering.
