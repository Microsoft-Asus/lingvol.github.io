It’s Aiko Hemingway with Schwagirl. I am an American English pronunciation coach and business coach based in Hawaii, USA. I came to the US from Japan when I was 23 years old, and I did not speak English well and had a hard time in the US communicating with native English speakers. I realized how important pronunciation basics were in my 6th year in the US, and I took accent reduction lessons, learned linguistics, phonetics and intonation study, and took singing lessons in order to improve my English. Now I help Japanese clients, who are in the US working in an English environment, improve their English pronunciation effectively.<br />As I learned how to market and promote my coaching business, now I teach English coaches how they can market and promote their coaching business. My business course is for English who want to start making 5k-10k dollars a month from their coaching business and start having a life where they can work less, and make more money.<br /><br />働く時間を減らして収入を増やしたいコーチ向けビジネスコーチング：<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aikohemingway.com/">https://www.aikohemingway.com/</a><br />Facebook: @hatsuonkyosei<br />Twitter: @aiko2232
