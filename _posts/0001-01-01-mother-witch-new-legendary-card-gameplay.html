Clash Royale New Legendary Card &quot;Mother Witch&quot; Gameplay!<br /><br />Subscribe to Me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/qFh722">https://goo.gl/qFh722</a><br /><br />Today Shane &amp; I will check out the new Mother Witch in a BO5 Showdown! <br /><br /><br />Today on TV Royale it was announced there is a NEW Legendary card, 4 elixir cost Mother Witch. Mother Witch will be the last card added in 2020 in Clash Royale. Today we'll feature some Mother Witch gameplay with SlashWithShane. New balance changes are also coming. Read below:<br /><br /><br />X-BOW REWORK<br />Lifetime Reduced 40s to 30s<br />Hit Speed Slower 0.25 to 0.3s<br />Damage Increased 30%<br />Health Reduced 4%<br /><br />X-Bow has been one of the most polarizing cards ever. We wanted to rework it to keep it a deadly threat but lessen its power as a defensive building. Now the bolts are more powerful than ever, able to kill enemies with fewer shots! But the X-Bow is more fragile, and does not last on the battlefield for nearly as long.<br /><br />GUARDS<br />Hitspeed Increased 10%<br />Health Reduced 32%<br /><br />This minor rework brings Guards down to the same health and attack speed as Skeletons for consistency. This results in a significant DPS buff for the little guys with a health tradeoff that will often not impact common interactions.<br /><br />BARBARIAN HUT<br />Health Reduction -22%<br /><br />Back when we reduced all spawner health after a spawner-heavy meta, Barb Hut was weaker and reduced less than others. The result – it is now the strongest. Bit of a health nerf so its not an effective blocker by itself.<br /><br />GRAVEYARD<br />Initial Spawn Time Delayed <br /><br />Graveyard has just been too strong for too long. It’s ability to be placed on top of towers makes it extremely consistent. We are delaying the amount of time it takes for the first Skeleton to appear, which results in 1 fewer Skeleton total.<br /><br />GOBLIN GIANT<br />Hitspeed Faster 1.7 to 1.5s<br />Want some buffs to mix in with all these nerfs. Goblins are fast, so lets speed up the Goblin Giant’s attacks so he’s a really threat when it connects.<br /><br />HEAL SPIRIT<br />Damage Reduced 59%<br />Heal Spirit is seeing widespread play because its just as effective as Ice Spirit at countering cards like Skeleton Army. Used defensively with a tower, it can be an effective counter to Goblin Gang because of its splash damage. Heal Spirit isn’t a combative soul, so we are reducing its damage significantly. Zap + Heal Spirit does not kill a Minion Horde.<br /> <br />FISHERMAN<br />Health Reduction -10%<br />The pulling effect is very powerful and we don’t want to hurt his main mechanic. Fisherman’s popularity in the meta is partially because he works well as a mini-tank, so we are reducing his health to make him more fragile against other mini-tanks.<br /><br />WITCH<br />Faster Initial Spawn 3.5s to 1s<br />She’s struggles to find value at 5 cost consistently. Letting the first Skeletons spawn faster provides a clearer use case (near-instant blocking). Should exist in the meta as a counter to PEKKA decks, which may return to prominence with Fisherman and Heal Spirit’s nerfs.<br /><br />ELECTRO WIZARD<br />Damage Reduced 2.5%<br />Fixing some rounding errors, the last nerf barely nudged the stats. This changes a few small interactions like making the entry Zap + 1 attack not enough damage to kill both Archers.<br /><br />SKELETON BARREL<br />Health Reduced -19%<br />Same Health as Skeleton Dragons/Magic Archer/Zappies – 440. Very popular on mid-ladder for whats supposed to be a niche card. When cast solo, it drops near the tower but not right on top of it.<br /><br />BATS (buff)<br />First Hit Increased 0.2s<br /><br />A few months ago, Bats had their hitspeed and first hit slowed 0.2s, this ended up being a larger nerf than expected, so we are returning some of the nerfed stats.<br /><br />*Shownotes*<br /><br />►►CLASHwithSHANE YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2VXfcj7">http://bit.ly/2VXfcj7</a><br />►►CLASHwithSHANE Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Y1WrAq">http://bit.ly/2Y1WrAq</a><br /><br /><br />#ClashRoyale #NewCard #WitchMother <br /><br />*Join my discord community!*<br /><br />►►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/cwamobilegaming">https://discordapp.com/invite/cwamobilegaming</a><br /><br /><br /><br />►►SECOND CHANNEL (Raid Shadow Legends)- <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/36Z4kY6">http://bit.ly/36Z4kY6</a><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm Proud to be a community partner with Bren Chong!<br /><br />►► Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/jEcVu1">https://goo.gl/jEcVu1</a><br /><br />►► Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/c1u5V8">https://goo.gl/c1u5V8</a><br /><br /><br /><br />►►Check out my player profile: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Ve4J1S">https://goo.gl/Ve4J1S</a><br /><br />►►Top deck text guides: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/NJzUuG">https://goo.gl/NJzUuG</a><br /><br /><br /><br />►►Leave a voicemail for the channel and you might appear in my next video!
