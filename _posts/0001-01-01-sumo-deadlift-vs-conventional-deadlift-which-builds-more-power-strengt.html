The debate about which is better is a question that seems to always come up. But which variation is going to help you build the most overall strength and power to lift the most weight? Well, let’s find out.<br /><br />CONVENTIONAL DEADLIFT<br />The conventional deadlift is up first. To perform this movement approach the barbell with your feet close together, either straight forward or slightly angled, and about shoulder width apart max. As you reach down to grab the barbell, keep your arms outside of your knees, chest up, core tight, maintain a neutral spine, lock your elbows and flex your lats. Once in place you are going to push through your feet and hips to lift the barbell off the ground until you lockout at the top. Now if you have never done this movement before, really focus on flexing your glutes to push through your hips at the sticking point of the exercise which is as the barbell is pulled up and over your knees. Because the exercise involves pushing through the hips we will be activating the surrounding hip and pelvic muscles.<br /><br />So what is happening inside your body during a conventional deadlift? First off, this movement places more emphasis on your posterior chain, mainly your back (lower back), hamstrings and spinal erectors when compared to the sumo deadlift. So if you have a very strong lower back and hamstrings, there is a good chance that you will be able to deadlift more using this method. Other major muscle groups being used here are your gluteus maximus, quadriceps and adductors and when compared to the sumo deadlift you will have greater muscle activity in your gastrocnemius which is one if the two major muscle groups that make up your calf. <br /><br />SUMO DEADLIFT<br />Now let’s take a look at the sumo deadlift. The set-up here is quite different and a bit more precise so you can’t just grip it and rip it like the conventional deadlift. Approach the barbell and stand with a wide stance. Your feet should be angled along the line that runs from the middle of your upper thigh to the middle of your ankle. This is important because if the angle of your feet is off you can put unwanted stress on your knees and actually reduce your leverage which is what you need for a max lift. Once in place you are going to grab the barbell with both hands, but this time you are going to have your arms on the inside of your knees. Keep your core tight, maintain a neutral spine, lock your arms, flex your lats and push through your heels and hips to lift the barbell off the floor.<br /><br />As you perform the movement you are probably going to notice right away that there is less stress on your lower back and the barbell did not travel as far. So if you are experiencing lower back issues or have a history of back problems, the sumo deadlift may be a better option for you. As for inside your body, we are still activating your gluteus maximus, hamstrings, quadriceps, adductors and gastrocnemius but there will be a bit more emphasis placed on your quadriceps and upper traps to perform the movement.<br /><br />THE QUESTION: WHICH IS BEST?<br />So which is the best variation? Well, first just like to address the people who think the sumo deadlift is “cheating”. This variation is fully accepted in powerlifting competitions and at the end of the day the method you pick comes down to which variation you can use to lift the most weight. <br /><br />But, to determine which deadlift variation is going to help you build the most overall strength and power to lift the most weight, there are quite a few things that need to be considered. The main point to keep in mind is that the deadlift variation you chose should be one that works best with your body type, injury history and goal. For example, there are competitive powerlifters that have broken records with both variations so to say one is better than the other comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />*CONTINUE READING HERE*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://muscularstrength.com/article/sumo-deadlift-vs-conventional-deadlift-power-strength">https://muscularstrength.com/article/sumo-deadlift-vs-conventional-deadlift-power-strength</a><br /><br />Program Selector -  Get The Right Program For You! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://muscularstrength.com/Program-Selector">https://muscularstrength.com/Program-Selector</a><br />----------------------------------------<br />Subscribe To My Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ScottHermanFitness">https://www.youtube.com/user/ScottHermanFitness</a><br />----------------------------------------<br />1 on 1 Online Coaching - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://muscularstrength.com/consultations">http://muscularstrength.com/consultations</a> <br />----------------------------------------<br />DOWNLOAD MY APP! – iPhone &amp; Android!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://muscularstrength.com/phoneapp">https://muscularstrength.com/phoneapp</a><br />----------------------------------------<br />MORE TIPS! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ScottHermanFitness">https://www.instagram.com/ScottHermanFitness</a>
