{% raw %}Keymer is one of the oldest established roofing brands in the UK crafting handmade tiles and fittings since 1588. <br /><br />The use of local, rich Wealden clay produces unique warm colours, textures and provides renowned durability. <br /><br />Keymerâ€™s rich heritage continues to thrive as it moves for the fourth time to its new home in Ewhurst, where the artisan approach and the same materials and methods are still being used to this day. <br /><br />Keymer tiles form a strong foundation for the heritage industry in the UK; it has two core product ranges and offers one of the only truly handmade tiles in Europe. <br /><br />The focus on maintaining the skills from the past whilst delivering a strong, long lasting clay roof tile means that every Keymer tile is a living piece of history.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.keymer.co.uk">http://www.keymer.co.uk</a>{% endraw %}
