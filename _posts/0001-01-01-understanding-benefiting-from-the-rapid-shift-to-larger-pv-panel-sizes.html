In this TechTalk, JA Solar mapped a path to lowering the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale PV power plants, through a greater understanding of the choices available in the era of multiple large-area solar panels with peak power ratings ranging from 400Wp to above 500Wp.<br /><br />JA also introduced its highest performing large-area PV panel series, DEEPBLUE 3.0, which integrates a number of key technologies to provide power outputs of over 525Wp.
