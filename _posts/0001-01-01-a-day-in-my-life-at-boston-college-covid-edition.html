I'm BACK with another day in my life at Boston College! It's my senior year at BC in 2020 and I show what it's like to be a college student on campus with in-person classes during this very ~unique~ time in the world. A lot has changed in my day in the life since the last time I did this video... :)<br /><br />~ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shanrizwan/">https://www.instagram.com/shanrizwan/</a><br />~ Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.somethingcreativepodcast.com/">https://www.somethingcreativepodcast.com/</a><br />~ Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/37gKVCX">https://spoti.fi/37gKVCX</a><br /><br />Business Inquiries only: shanzacharia@gmail.com<br /><br />If you're reading this, comment &quot;this vid needs a fire alarm&quot; (lol im so clever)
