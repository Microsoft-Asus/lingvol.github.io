From legendary cats, to fish of the sea, to birds of the ancient world, and more! Here are 9 extinct animals that may actually still be alive!<br /><br />Subscribe For New Videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/UIzLeB">http://goo.gl/UIzLeB</a><br /><br />9. Coelacanth<br />It may seem odd to posit that creatures who died potentially thousands or millions of years ago may actually still be alive in the modern day, but there has been proof of this happening in the past, including with creatures that were believed to have been extinct for 65 million years. In this case, the Coelacanth.<br /><br />8. Saber-Toothed Tiger<br />There are many legendary cats who exist in this modern age, but none of them compare to the power and ability that the Saber-Toothed Tiger once had. These massive cats were the ancestors to what exists today in many ways, and yet they were more aggressive, more powerful, and able to do things even lions and tigers couldn't dream of.<br /><br />7. Thylacine<br />The Thylacine, or the Tasmanian Tiger/Wolf, was one of the most feared animals in all of Australia and New Zealand at one point in time. Which brings us to the fact that they were a more recent extinction animal as they were wiped out within the last century. Despite being part of the Marsupial family, these creatures were Apex Predators, able to roam the land and get food without much pushback.<br /><br />6. Short-Faced Bear<br />The Ice Age was once home to a bear that was much bigger, much heavier, and much more aggressive than the ones today. It was known as the Short-Faced Bear, and though it's been extinct for ten thousand years, there are those who swear it's still alive today.<br /><br />5. Megalania<br />In Australia during the Ice Age, there was a creature that roamed the Outback as the Apex Predator of the land, it was a massive lizard known as the Megalania.<br />This monitor lizard was 23 feet long and was said to have a mouth full of teeth that were not only sharp, they were also extremely venomous. Thus ensuring it was an even deadlier Apex Predator.<br /><br />4. The Moa<br />The Moa was a flightless bird said to have grown over 12 feet tall at its peak thanks to its long neck, and could weigh over a ton at times. Interestingly enough, the Moa was a very isolated bird, it lived on an island off the coast of New Zealand, and would eat plants for sustenance.<br /><br />3. Woolly Mammoth<br />The Woolly Mammoth stands as the most recognizable animal of the Ice Age, and though they have been extinct for more than 8,000 years ago there are some who think they are still alive.<br />This is not just random speculation too, in the 1920's, a Frenchman heard tale of a sighting of a Woolly Mammoth, noting the following:<br /><br />2. Javan Tiger<br />You might not think that &quot;big cats&quot; die out too often in modern times, but you would be wrong, and the Javan Tiger is a great example of this. This tiger was found in Indonesia on the island of Java, where it got its name. But that island was also its downfall. You see, the island ensured that hunters could go there and kill the tigers with little issue, and thus, they were soon wiped out.<br /><br />1. Megalodon<br />Sharks have been a large part of the oceans dating all the way back to the dinosaurs. However, the biggest of them all was the Megalodon. Which was not only the largest shark ever (even compared to modern sharks like the Whale Shark) but it was the most aggressive and dangerous.
