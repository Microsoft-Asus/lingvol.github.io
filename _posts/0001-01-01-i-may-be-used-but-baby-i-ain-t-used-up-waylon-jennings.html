Well my baby you're a looker and I know what you're looking for<br />You've been looking over, every man at the bar<br />Honey, I know I've got a few years on you<br />But if you're shopping around let me tell you a thing or two<br /><br />Well I look a little rough and I got a few miles on me<br />My body needs work and my style ain't what it used to be<br />And honey I'll admit there's places where I'm wearing thin<br />But I ain't broke down, I just couldn't hold it in<br /><br />Well I may be worn, but baby I ain't worn out<br />Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about<br />I guarantee, there's a lot of me left to love<br />Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up<br /><br />I've been wrecked a few times and honey it shows I guess<br />There's been once or twice that you could say that I was repossesed<br />There's one little thing that I think ought to be understood<br />It aint how you look, it's what you got under your hood<br /><br />Well I may be worn, but baby I ain't worn out<br />Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about<br />I guarantee, there's a lot of me left to love<br />Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up
