The sea<br />monster is huge and has jaws that could decimate a ship. The Meg, as it is often called, is the stuff that<br />makes up nightmares. In the ancient days, stories of a wild large whale that roamed the open waters<br />were told by old sailors to young ones. We now know that this creature of the myths was probably the<br />Meg.<br />Thankfully, the Meg is extinct today. Well, that&amp;#39;s what we think at least. Recent sightings tell us that this<br />may not be true. Today, we&amp;#39;ll be going through ten sightings of the Meg that may prove that it&amp;#39;s still very<br />much alive!<br /><br />#10 Evidence Of A Baby Megalodon<br />Megs are pretty huge animals, and even baby Megs can reach impossible lengths of more than twenty<br />feet. That&amp;#39;s longer than the average school bus! This video is one of the pieces of evidence that&amp;#39;s usually<br />put forward when people ask about the existence of the Megalodon. But is it real?<br />The video shows divers minding their business in a cage, while a huge shark that is over 20 feet long<br />swam around them. Is this huge shark a Megalodon?<br />First off, we need to know that normal sharks rarely grow as huge as this, so this is by no means a<br />regular video. The video was published by Mauricio Hoyes, and even though he didn&amp;#39;t call the shark a<br />Megalodon, he called it the biggest shark he&amp;#39;d ever seen.<br />Now, we know that even though this shark is pretty big, it couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be an adult Megalodon<br />because they generally reach lengths of about 60 feet. So maybe it&amp;#39;s just a baby Meg, not an adult one.<br />What do you think? Do you think is a baby Meg?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/id7vJQT809c">https://youtu.be/id7vJQT809c</a><br /><br />#9 The Meg In Japan<br />This video is peculiar because it&amp;#39;s extremely realistic. In fact, it&amp;#39;s probably one of the most realistic Meg<br />videos we have ever seen. But is it real? Let&amp;#39;s find out.<br /><br />First off, the video appears to have been taken by an underwater webcam. So it looks pretty eerie. It<br />was taken in Asia, and it&amp;#39;s the only Meg sighting that in the region.<br />But why would an underwater cam be here in any case? Our best guess is that the cam was a part of a<br />military installation like a submarine or an aircraft carrier. That&amp;#39;s why the pictures from the webcam are<br />so clear.<br />So what did the camera capture? This.<br />This looks like a big shark— a shark so big that it could be the famed Megalodon of the myths. The<br />video clearly shows a huge animal that may be dead or just resting in the ocean. It&amp;#39;s easy to say that this<br />video is faked, by extensive tests have shown that it is actually real.<br />The problem now is that we don&amp;#39;t know which animal is lying on the ground. It looks huge for sure, but<br />we don&amp;#39;t have evidence that it&amp;#39;s a Meg. We just know that it looks larger than anything we&amp;#39;ve ever seen.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/W-j0kFE82jk">https://youtu.be/W-j0kFE82jk</a><br /><br />#8 The Meg On The Coast Of Brazil<br />The events you&amp;#39;re about to see on this deeply shocking video happened on November 20th, 2012. It<br />started off as a pretty normal day on the coast until the Brazilian coastguard got a call. There was a<br />swimmer drowning in the sea, and they had to save him. It sounded like a pretty routine rescue mission,<br />and it may have just been just that.<br />The Coastguard got into their helicopters and started looking for the drowning swimmer. The plan was<br />simple— find him, set a ladder down, and rescue him. Pretty, standard, right?<br />Now, the coastguard often attaches cameras to their helicopters. This is done for record-keeping and<br />training purposes. As they approached the rescue spot, the camera caught something extremely<br />disturbing. Just near where the swimmer was swimming for help, there appeared to be a huge shadow<br />passing beneath the waves. It was certainly not a white whale as the shadow was bigger than that, and<br />it couldn&amp;#39;t have been an orca either.<br />There&amp;#39;s only one explanation. It was Megalodon. Look at the video again and tell us what you think. Do<br />you think the shadow beneath the waves was a Megalodon or not?<br /><br />#7 The Megalodon Vs. The Kayak<br />Kayaks is pretty small boats that can be overturned by a large enough wave. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s not advisable<br />to use one in parts of the sea where the waves could get too overwhelming. However, that&amp;#39;s one advice<br />that this man didn&amp;#39;t take. He took his Kayak, went off into the ocean, and got the shock of his life.
