Stunning Control Tower and Drone video of the moment the Arecibo Observatory telescope platform collapsed and smashed into the dish on 12/1/2020.<br /><br /><br /><br />Completed in 1963 and stewarded by U.S. National Science Foundation since the 1970s, Arecibo Observatory has contributed to many important scientific discoveries, including the demonstration of gravitational waves from a binary pulsar, the first discovery of an extrasolar planet, composition of the ionosphere, and the characterization of the properties and orbits of a number of potentially hazardous asteroids.
