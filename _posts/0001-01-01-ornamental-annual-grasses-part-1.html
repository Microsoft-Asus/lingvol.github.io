You won't want to take a mower to these... they're too unique and are perfect for adding some height or texture to your garden.<br /><br />One thing to note about some of the fountain grasses are their fluffy plumesâ€”cut these at the end of the season and use the in your fall flower arrangements.<br /><br />Featured Ornamental Annual Grasses:<br />- Pennisetum setaceum (Rosy Fountain Grass)<br />- Pennisetum setaceum 'Rubrum'<br />- Pennisetum setaceum 'Fireworks'<br />- Pennisetum purpureum 'Prince'<br />- Pampas Grass<br /><br /><br />======================<br /><br />Other parts of the series:<br />Part 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/noo1Z5zDBhs">http://youtu.be/noo1Z5zDBhs</a><br />Part 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/m7YnFXs-Cek">http://youtu.be/m7YnFXs-Cek</a><br /><br />======================<br /><br />The Greenery Garden Centre is located in Kelowna, BC.
