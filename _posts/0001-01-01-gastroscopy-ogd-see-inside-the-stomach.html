Want to really see inside your stomach and esophagus? Here is a recent gastroscopy | OGD that I personally performed. This endoscopy procedure is also called an OGD, EGD or gastroscopy procedure. I review the relevant anatomy of the upper GI tract for this endoscopic test on a model so that you can understand the anatomy of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. I discuss how to prepare for your OGD. Gastroscopy can be done with sedation and without sedation. Patients prepare for the scope test by having no solid food for 8 hours, but clear fluids can be taken up to 3 hours preprocedure. The endoscopic video demonstrates endoscopic biopsies, visualization of the tongue, mouth, uvula, epiglottis, vocal cords, esophagus, GE junction, stomach, duodenum and duodenal villi. The OGD typically takes 10 minutes to do but there can be add-on procedures such as balloon dilatation of the esophagus for strictures or injection or clipping of bleeding stomach or duodenal ulcers which can take longer. The OGD when done without sedation utilizes local anaesthetic, lidocaine, sprayed onto the mouth and throat.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER : Thank you for watching my YouTube video.
