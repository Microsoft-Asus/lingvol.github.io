{% raw %}Learn how to use the words this, that, these and those with this English grammar lesson.<br /><br />These words are used as demonstrative adjectives and sometimes simply as demonstrative pronouns.<br /><br />We use &quot;this&quot; to refer to nouns (objects or people) in the singular which are close to the speaker and &quot;these&quot; for the plural.<br /><br />For nouns far from the speaker, &quot;that&quot; is used for the singular and those in the plural. <br /><br />For actions in the present or the near future, we use &quot;this&quot;, for example, &quot;This meal is nice&quot; (during the meal).<br /><br />But for actions which have finished and in the past, we use &quot;that&quot;. Example talking about a football match: &quot;That match was great yesterday.&quot;<br /><br />We always use &quot;this is&quot; when introducing ourselves and other people.<br /><br />At the end of the English grammar lesson about the demonstratives, I give you an exercise to test your understanding. Please answer the questions in the comments section and I will tell you if your answers are right or wrong :)<br /><br />Private English lessons &amp; speaking practice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/e7xuDt">http://goo.gl/e7xuDt</a><br /><br />More grammar lessons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpS4_AM1c0s0ozpROeE2A9ff">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpS4_AM1c0s0ozpROeE2A9ff</a><br /><br /><br />Listening exercises: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpRdmnAzmYwdc0Az0ZOG2XNA">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpRdmnAzmYwdc0Az0ZOG2XNA</a><br /><br /><br />Vocabulary videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpTlYAYSitjwWn29BEdCBi9j">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpTlYAYSitjwWn29BEdCBi9j</a><br /><br /><br />Andrew,<br />Crown Academy of English<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.crownacademyenglish.com">http://www.crownacademyenglish.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CrownAcademyEnglish">http://www.youtube.com/user/CrownAcademyEnglish</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Crown_English">https://twitter.com/Crown_English</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Photo credits:<br /><br />&quot;Man Having Severe Headache&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Young student showing pointing down&quot; Image courtesy of imagerymajestic | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;The Brand New Laptop Is Out For Sale&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Happy Family&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Groom In Tuxedo Posing With A Bouquet&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Businesswoman Holding Shoes&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Young Businessman Who Sits On A Chair At The Top Of The Mountain&quot; Image courtesy of pat138241 | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Handsome Guy Looking Far Away&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Cheerful Businessman Pointing Away&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages| FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Lady Looking Through Binocular&quot; Image courtesy of imagerymajestic | FreeDigitalPhotos.net <br />&quot;Multi Ethnic Team During Meeting&quot; Image courtesy of Ambro | FreeDigitalPhotos.net{% endraw %}
