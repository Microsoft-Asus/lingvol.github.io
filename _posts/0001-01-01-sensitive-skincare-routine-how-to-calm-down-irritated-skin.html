Love, Liah x 🌴<br /><br />-<br /><br />Regarding the prolonged contact with tap water and its effect on our skin barrier »<br /><br />Non-scientific literature is publically available (such as magazines, newspapers and product information) that attributes the occurrence of skin disease to tap water exposure. This is of concern to Regulators and to the public, if their water is perceived to be sub-standard. There may be potential cost to water companies due to time spent monitoring and investigating water quality and literature to re-assure the public. Indications from customer contacts received by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) suggest that the medical profession may play a role in prompting this association. It is important that any postulated association between tap water and ill health is investigated. Currently, there has not been a substantiated review exploring all possible attributing factors of the evidence for, or against, skin irritation and tap water quality.
