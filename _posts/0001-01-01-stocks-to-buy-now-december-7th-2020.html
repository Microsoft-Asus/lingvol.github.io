It does have a little bit room to drop still, and that is what the indicators say. But keep your eyes on this play, because once it reverses (soon) it will go loooooong.<br /><br />$EVBG - Holding support right at the main volume support line, and in channel still. Can it drop a tad more, yes - but may not be worth waiting. All EMA lines are below it so it obviously has strength to run!<br /><br />$FSLR - Another clean energy company here that has a tad more to drop. It is above support and all EMA lines though. So if it drops a few dollars, a better deal! IF it does not and reverses here, go looooong! Looking beautiful!<br /><br />$HD - What a strong and beautiful support. It appears to be trying to make this its new channel - and the Stoch, MACD, and RSI cannot get lower. Everyone sees this play developing, go long first thing in the morning.<br /><br />$HRL - Earnings murdered it right to a beautiful price. All EMA lines are above so not much resistance to be had until 5% in! Volume is above so it wants to be gravitationally pulled up here. It may come down a tad, then re-take off.<br /><br />$JD - Above channel, and has plenty of room to keep running. I really like this triangle it formed, and it has a bunch of steam. Stoch and MACD very low showing volume pending, lets get in before the volume!<br /><br />$JKS - Set alerts above and below this one, and let it blast off of earnings or die off of earnings. This play is all pending their meeting - it may be a beautiful trade - or a blood bath to wait on finishing.<br /><br />$NFLX - Triangle break out we called is coming back for a re-test. First time in a LONG time it has cleared the 50 and 200EMA. If it breaks out here, go long for the next month it'll go crazy!<br /><br />$PPL - Channel play at the support line above the 200EMA?! Convergence?! Go long baby this is gonna blow.<br /><br />$WCN - Simple ascending channel and trendline play. If it holds here easy 6% at least AND and eventual breakout! This is a gorgeous play.<br /><br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />1:54 - CSIQ<br />3:45 - EVBG<br />5:10 - FSLR<br />6:44 - HD<br />8:11 - HRL<br />9:45 - JD<br />12:00 - JKS<br />13:55 - NFLX<br />15:23 - PPL<br />17:19 - WCN
