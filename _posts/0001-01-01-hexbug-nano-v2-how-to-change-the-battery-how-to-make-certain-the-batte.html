Here I show how to change the battery in the New HexBug Nano V2. You will need One button cell 1.5 volt battery AG13 (LR44) + One cross head / Philips head screw driver.<br /><br />Please check out my channel for other videos:<br />I have made a series of videos that will show all the new special pieces and sets.<br />I have videos showing the Nano V2 with the original Nano V1 in Races and Battles.<br />I have videos that show the old and new habitat sets and track mixed up.<br /><br />This was filmed in 1080p with my Canon 650D camera mounted on a tripod.<br />I use both background lights as well as a camera flash shoe light.
