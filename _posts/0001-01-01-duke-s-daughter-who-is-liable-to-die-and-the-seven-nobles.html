Light Novel: Shini Yasui Kōshaku Reijō To Nana Ri No Kikōshi (Duke's Daughter Who Is Liable To Die And The Seven Nobles)<br /><br />Author: Terasu Senoo<br /><br />Link To Read The Light Novel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://starrynightnovels.wordpress.com/dukes-daughter-and-the-seven-nobles/">https://starrynightnovels.wordpress.com/dukes-daughter-and-the-seven-nobles/</a><br /><br />Genre(s):<br />Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, Shoujo<br /><br />Status: Ongoing<br /><br />Summary (From Starry Night Translation):<br /><br />On one spring evening when I was eight years old, I, Erica, Duke of Aurelia’s daughter, realized something.<br /><br />Huh, I have gotten reincarnated into a fantasy world, haven’t I?<br /><br />Moreover, it was the romance-fantasy girl game that had the reputation of being bloody, 『Liber Monstrorum ~Phantom Beasts and the Winter Princess~』<br /><br />The face reflected in the mirror was that of the villainess character of that game.<br /><br />After repeatedly harassing many characters, including the heroine, she would die without exception, signaling the beginning of an event called the bizarre incident. She was a villain who deserved to get the consequences! <br /><br />—I absolutely don’t want a destiny like that, though?<br /><br />No, for me who has remembered the memory of my previous life, there would be no such thing.<br /><br />In my previous life, I was harassed immensely by an irrationally angry yandere man who proclaimed ‘She is absolutely in love with me.’<br /><br />My cause of death, too, was from being stabbed by another yandere man who I only had talked with a few times……<br /><br />Now that I have become the haughty villainess Erica, I shouldn’t encounter more misunderstandings like with the previous life’s yandere men anymore, right……?<br /><br />In that case, it will be fine as long as I deal with the death flags that I may have raised myself.<br /><br />All right! First of all, before the bizarre incident begins at the Magic Academy, I will strike down the death flags accordingly!!<br /><br />—Or so I thought, but it seems that I am about to die.<br /><br />Eeh, how did this happen—!?<br /><br /><br />Music: Merry Go Round Of Life<br />Artist: Joe Hisaishi<br /><br />Note that the music is from Howl's Moving Castle.*<br /><br />You can buy the music on Amazon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Merry-Go-Round-Life-Howls-Moving-Castle/dp/B077TRHNKQ/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548611263&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=merry+go+round+of+life">https://www.amazon.com/Merry-Go-Round-Life-Howls-Moving-Castle/dp/B077TRHNKQ/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548611263&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=merry+go+round+of+life</a><br /><br />I really enjoy reading this light novel, which is why I created this video. The story is quite unique, and the images are gorgeous. The world building is also amazingly detailed and the author does a very good job in describing it in such a way that it isn't an information dump.<br /><br />Currently, the light novel is only printed and sold in its native language, Japanese. However, I hope that it becomes popular enough so that it can also be sold in English as I really enjoy reading the story.<br /><br />Starry Night Translation's website also includes the links where you can buy the light novel. Most of the images in the video come from his/her website. The others are from Google.
