When it comes to how to lose fat faster and how to break through fat loss plateaus, one of the first tools people turn to is cardio. And while it’s true that incorporating cardio can indeed be an effective way to lose fat faster, let’s face it; cardio sucks. For the majority of people, including myself, it’s more often than not just flat out unenjoyable – which is why so many people struggle with implementing and adhering to a cardio routine. But what if there was one exercise exercise that enabled you to lose fat faster without even breaking a sweat. Well there is, and it’s walking – which I’d view as the easiest exercise to burn fat and something you should start incorporating for a variety of reasons. One of the major benefits of walking for weight loss is that it doesn’t take much effort to result in quite a bit of extra fat loss. For example, an additional 150 minutes of bris kwalking per week can lead to an extra 1 pound of fat loss per week! And not only that, but the fact that walking has a minimal impact on appetite and recovery means that it’s an excellent way to burn calories without interfering with other aspects of your diet and training. In fact, I’d view it as the best exercise to lose fat if you really dread most forms of cardio. The only downside with walking is that if you want to lose fat fast, then you’d want to also incorporate more intense forms of exercise which I discuss in my video.
