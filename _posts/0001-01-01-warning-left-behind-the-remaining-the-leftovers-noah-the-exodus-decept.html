{% raw %}For two sermons on the topic of the rapture by Rob Cartledge watch<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiBAofKE0KU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiBAofKE0KU</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ezGHtGnNI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ezGHtGnNI</a><br />In this video we question the agenda behind the making of the movies Left Behind directed by Vic Armstrong, The Remaining directed by Casey La Scala, The Leftovers created by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta airing on HBO.<br /><br />Whenever Hollywood makes a movie on a religious theme, we must be very discerning of the general mindset of producers and directors in Hollywood, in that they are generally haters of the one true God and His Christ.<br /><br />Now we have in one year, three movies made about a rapture theory that much of Christianity in the West has embraced. My question is what is the agenda of Hollywood if they are spending so much money to create these movies?<br /><br />Left Behind, The Remaining, The Leftovers,<br /><br />Left Behind: Based on the novel by Tim LaHaye, starring Nicolas Cage released in 2014 focusses on the events post the rapture of the church. It is a remake of the 2000 Christian film under the same title starring Kirk Cameron.<br /><br />The Remaining released in 2014 is also a film based the same theme as Left Behind, those remaining after the rapture of the Church and how they handle the paranormal activity on earth, it draws from the book of revelation for its inspiration.<br /><br />The leftovers also premiered in 2014 as a TV series and shows the state of humanity after 2% of the population suddenly goes missing after a global event called the sudden departure.<br /><br />Visit: www.blessedhopechapelsa.com<br />www.robcartledge.com<br />We meet at Blessed Hope Chapel 390 Goodwood Rd, Cumberland Park, South Australia each Sunday at 10am<br />Sister church of Blessed Hope Chapel in California, pastored by Joe Schimmel... www.blessedhopechapel.org<br />Podcasts visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blessedhopechapelsa.com/podcasts/">http://www.blessedhopechapelsa.com/podcasts/</a><br />Rob's Blog: www.robcartledge.blogspot.com.au<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BlessedChapel">https://twitter.com/BlessedChapel</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blessed-Hope-Chapel/176075081904">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blessed-Hope-Chapel/176075081904</a><br /><br />Author of the 3 stirring Books &quot;God's Heart Cry for Revival&quot; &quot;Taking Up Your Cross&quot; &quot;So You Think You Are Baptised With the Holy Spirit?&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blessedhopechapelsa.com/books/">http://www.blessedhopechapelsa.com/books/</a>{% endraw %}
