I do not own the rights to this video, but I have had a copy ever since it was brand new (I obtained a copy via CD while I was in Iraq).  This video was created by (Commando JK -<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gmattp77">https://www.youtube.com/user/gmattp77</a> and his unit) the 22nd Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, attached to 101st Airborne Division Public Affairs Office, and released about 3 months after our invasion.  Naturally the amount of casualties is a lot higher now.  The voice over the radio who addressed himself as &quot;Eagle Six&quot; is actually General David Petraeus (my former Commanding General).  'Six' is the code given for all commanders.  Eagle is what he was known as via radio because of the obvious reason (Screaming Eagles).  Enjoy!
