As the nation continues to watch for news on Donald Trump's health since his COVID-19 diagnosis on October 3rd, so too does the President's ex-wife, Ivana Trump. According to People magazine, Ivana has been receiving updates on Trump's condition through the couple's three children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka. <br /><br />Ivana admits she is stressed about the situation, and even called her ex-husband &quot;careless.&quot; <br /><br />Ivana's fear stems in part from all of the unknowns associated with the coronavirus. <br /><br />Meanwhile, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, stated on October 4th that he believes, quote, &quot;there is a very significant level of concern right now&quot; about the president's health.<br /><br />Trump is 74 years old, and with a body mass index of 30-point-5, falls into the category of obesity, which, according to the CDC, increases his risk of complications from COVID-19. Apart from her concerns about her ex-husband's illness, Ivana also offered her opinion on his attitude towards the virus and his efforts at re-election.<br /><br />Trump has long been criticized for all the ways in which he has downplayed the severity of the coronavirus. He has blatantly ignored public health officials' suggestions to wear a mask and practice social distancing, behavior Ivana referred to as &quot;careless,&quot; telling People, quote, &quot;He didn't think it would happen to him.&quot;<br /><br />Most recently, at the first presidential debate that took place three days before Trump's positive diagnosis, Trump mocked Joe Biden for his mask habits while Trump himself and several members of his family refused to wear masks inside the debate hall.<br /><br />On the whole, the first presidential debate was unlike any other; some have even called it an embarrassment. But Ivana, who was married to Donald from 1977 to 1992, went further. <br /><br />Anyone who followed Donald and Ivana Trump's messy divorce may be surprised that Ivana chimes in on her ex-husband's politics at all. However, Ivana told ABC News in 2017 that they have mended their relationship, they talk often, and she sometimes even gives him political advice. <br /><br />The businesswoman and former model also revealed she believed decades ago that Trump could be successful as President, if it wasn't for his affair, referring to Trump's relationship with Marla Maples in the early 1990s, which ended Ivana and Donald's marriage. <br /><br />In 2018, halfway through Trump's first term in office, Ivana seemed to feel Trump's presidency had run its course. She told Page Six she didn't feel Donald should run for a second term. <br /><br />Ivana went on to describe the pressures of the presidency, implying Trump got more than he bargained for in his role as leader of the free world. <br /><br />But now, less than a month away from Election Day and despite a controversial showing at the first presidential debate, Ivana has changed her tune about Trump. <br /><br />Keep watching to see how Ivana Trump Turns Heads With Recent Comments On Donald!<br /><br />#IvanaTrump #DonaldTrump<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thelist.com/256307/ivana-trump-turns-heads-with-recent-comments-on-donald/">https://www.thelist.com/256307/ivana-trump-turns-heads-with-recent-comments-on-donald/</a>
