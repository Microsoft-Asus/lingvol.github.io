Today we wanted to show you one of our favorite games headbanz! Dad and I started to set it up and mom tried to turn the tv on, but mom said the wifi wasn't working. Since the wifi was out and mom didn't know why she started to get really frustrated with the internet being out! Hawk Moth could feel the anger and sent an evil butterfly to akumatize mom!! Then she turned into Lady Wifi and started to tear the basement up!! Luckily Dad and I have a secret! We are superheroes called LadyBug and Cat Noir!! We hurried and changed and went downstairs to stop lady wifi from terrorizing the house!! We each used our superpowers like my lucky carm, dad used his staff, and we used the power of team work! Lady Wifi also had some pretty good powers! She could freeze us, she could make us rewind time, and she turned Cat Noir into a Kitten!! <br /><br />my last video - MY PET BALLOON DOG!! meet Squeakee our new puppy! showing Niko &amp; Mom all his fun dog tricks<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-4BpJVVdjFM">https://youtu.be/-4BpJVVdjFM</a><br /><br />my dad's last video - Baby Navey meets Niko &amp; Adley ðŸ’• Hospital Story with Jenny and our kids made an indoor castle fort!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8EaVDcp508I">https://youtu.be/8EaVDcp508I</a><br /><br />Bye vlog *pshhhhh*
