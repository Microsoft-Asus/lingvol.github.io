{% raw %}This video is going to show you how Tableau calculates the numbers using Level of Detail (LOD) - INCLUDE. Although a dimension may not be in the view, we can still use level of detail to bring in that dimension when calculating the aggregated numbers, while not affecting the numbers of other dimensions.<br /><br />Thanks for watching.
