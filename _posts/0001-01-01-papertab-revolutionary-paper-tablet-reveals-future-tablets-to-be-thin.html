Intel®, Plastic Logic and Queen's University work together to revolutionize tablet computing<br /><br />Cambridge, UK and Kingston, Canada - January 7, 2013 -- Watch out tablet lovers -- A flexible paper computer developed at Queen's University in collaboration with Plastic Logic and Intel Labs will revolutionize the way people work with tablets and computers. The PaperTab tablet looks and feels just like a sheet of paper. However, it is fully interactive with a flexible, high-resolution 10.7&quot; plastic display developed by Plastic Logic, a flexible touchscreen, and powered by the second generation Intel® Core i5 processor. Instead of using several apps or windows on a single display, users have ten or more interactive displays or &quot;papertabs&quot;: one per app in use.<br /><br />Ryan Brotman, research scientist at Intel elaborates &quot;We are actively exploring disruptive user experiences. the 'PaperTab' project, developed by the Human Media Lab at Queen's University and Plastic Logic, demonstrates innovative interactions powered by Intel core processors that could potentially delight tablet users in the future.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Using several PaperTabs makes it much easier to work with multiple documents,&quot; says Roel Vertegaal, director of Queen's University's Human Media Lab. &quot;Within five to ten years, most computers, from ultra-notebooks to tablets, will look and feel just like these sheets of printed color paper.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Plastic Logic's flexible plastic displays are completely transformational in terms of product interaction. they allow a natural human interaction with electronic paper, being lighter, thinner and more robust compared with today's standard glass-based displays. this is just one example of the innovative revolutionary design approaches enabled by flexible displays.&quot; explains Indro Mukerjee, CEO of Plastic Logic.<br /><br />For more info, see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.humanmedialab.org/papertab">http://www.humanmedialab.org/papertab</a> and come see it at CES 2013 in Las Vegas.
