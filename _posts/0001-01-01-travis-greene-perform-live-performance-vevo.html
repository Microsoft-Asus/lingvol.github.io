Travis Greene -  Perform  (Live Performance)<br /><br />Inspiration, dedication, communication - Travis Greene's music spreads a vibe of encouragement and bonding. His self-description on his Social accounts reads, &quot;a pastor who worships,&quot; and as such the South Carolina preacher, whose career as Christian pop artist becomes more and more impressive with each year, has touched a lot of souls with his music. He and his ensemble hit our NYC studios for an intimate and powerful spin on the comforting message of &quot;Perform.&quot; It feels like a strong arm wrapping around your shoulder in a time of doubt.
