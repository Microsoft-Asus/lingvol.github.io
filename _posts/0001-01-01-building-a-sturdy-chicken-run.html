{% raw %}Building the chicken run has been a challenge due to the drastic difference in the elevations from the chicken coop to the run.  We also had to make the run strong to avoid predators from harming the chickens.  This video gives an overview of how we met the challenges at hand and how the chickens are doing today in their new environment.  <br /><br />What is A Place to Grow?<br />     A Place to Grow demonstrates how to garden, homestead, improve agricultural buildings, and renovate a 1912 farmhouse.  Horticulture and agriculture are deeply rooted in our lifestyle.  Our goal is to teach others the art of gardening.  We hope you enjoy watching our experiences of simple country living as our farm expands.  Please join our YouTube family by subscribing to us today!{% endraw %}
