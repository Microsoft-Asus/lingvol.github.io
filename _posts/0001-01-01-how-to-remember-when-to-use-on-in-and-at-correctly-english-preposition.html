Do you get the prepositions ON, IN and AT confused when trying to schedule a meeting or when you tell a story in English? Is so, this video is for you!  Instead of remembering the rules, here is a super helpful way to think about it that'll help you to always get it right. <br />This is part 1 of a two-part video series. Next week we'll talk about on, in and at when it comes to space/place. <br />UPD: the second part of the series <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AuIzPgb3vvo">https://youtu.be/AuIzPgb3vvo</a> <br />Get your journey started (FREE stuff to give you a confidence and fluency boost):<br />🚀Fluency Challenge &amp; FB Community (Best thing ever): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/68pqeF">https://goo.gl/68pqeF</a><br />🚀American Accent AUDIO crash course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/wSVyua">https://goo.gl/wSVyua</a><br />🚀50 words you probably mispronounce (interactive list): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nLtjtW">https://goo.gl/nLtjtW</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Let's Stay Connected:👇🏼<br />📢Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theaccentsway.com/">http://theaccentsway.com/</a><br />✊ Non-native SPEAKERZ empowering Community (FB): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/68pqeF">https://goo.gl/68pqeF</a><br />📷INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2M4Tg2R">https://bit.ly/2M4Tg2R</a>  <br />📌PINTEREST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2TL6lSm">https://bit.ly/2TL6lSm</a><br />♥️FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/TheAccentsWay/">https://facebook.com/TheAccentsWay/</a><br />📧EMAIL: hello@accentsway.com<br />-<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Questions you probably want to ask me: <br />🗣️Are you a native speaker? NO<br />🌏Where are you from? Tel-Aviv, Israel (I speak Hebrew)<br />❓ How did you lose your accent? I learned acting in NYC and acquired an American Accent. So I never really lost anything. I also talk about it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PShZ9s">https://goo.gl/PShZ9s</a><br />🤔 How can I sound more like a native speaker? You don't have to. A foreign accent is not a bad thing. It's a part of your identity. Of who you are. Your goal should be to sound clear, to have an impact when you speak,  and to feel confident in your English voice so that you never let your English hold you back or prevent you from achieving your goals. Aiming for 'speaking like a native' sets the bar so high,  you may get discourages and won't even dare to try. #CommunicationOverPerfection<br />😩What's the worst thing about traditional English training? It's taught as if everyone has the name needs. And it's mostly boring. <br />🇺🇸Do native speakers think you are American? At first. But later in the conversation, they may detect a subtle accent. Depends on what I'm talking about and how tired I am. I don't care about it too much though, I'm a proud non-native speaker ✊<br />🇮🇱🇵🇸What do you think about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? I think land is not worth dying or fighting for. I will always promote peace and co-existence. And for me communication in English is a way to overcome political and cultural barriers. <br />🎓Do you teach 1:1? I don't. I have an amazing colleague, Natalie, who teaches 1:1 at my school and online using my methods. I also have an online program called Accent Makeover that runs 2-3 times a year.

Speaking English with an accent. Getting stuck. <br />Your voice and your identity make you unique. There are enough Native English speakers out there in the world... You don't need to become another one. Find your own voice.  It's important to improve your pronunciation and fluency so you feel more confident and capable. So YOU can express yourself better, and minimize the gap between your native tongue and your English. <br />And If someone makes fun or judges you because of your accent, simply ask back:<br />Oh, and how many languages do YOU speak?! 😏<br />People who only speak one language don't always understand what it means to overcome the challenges of speaking a foreign language. Don't feel self-conscious. Teach them.<br />❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
