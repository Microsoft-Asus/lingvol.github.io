Caps are an essential part of Fallout 4. You use them to buy ammo, Stimpaks, weapons, and can even bribe people with them. But what if you pretended that caps don't exist?

(in text form)<br /><br />Up first, as always, is our SPECIAL setup. Because Charisma in Fallout 4 is pretty much only used to get extra caps from quest-givers, it’s a useless stat. Maxed out Intelligence gives us more experience points for every action, letting us level up faster. Perception isn’t all that important, so I spread the remaining points out evenly into Strength, Endurance, Agility, and Luck. I could have put more into Luck, but I was only concerned with getting the Scrounger perk to find extra ammo, and it only requires 2 points in Luck. <br /><br />I ran to the vault, experienced the deep freeze, watched my wife die, woke up and tried to ignore the freezer burn. Not a lot to do in the vault. Out into the world and… I finally fixed the textures! It looks so beautiful with grass, doesn’t it? I went west for a change of pace and killed a few Raiders, a dog, a few Bloatflies, and upped my arsenal before heading to Sanctuary. There, I leveled up and got the Aquaboy perk to avoid radiation damage in water, upgraded my 10mm Pistol, spoke to Codsworth, put the extra SPECIAL point into Endurance just to make life in the wasteland a little less miserable, found Dogmeat, and arrived at the Museum of Freedom. I killed the Raiders inside, picked a lock, got through the conversation with Preston as quickly as possible, and stepped into my Power Armor. Finally, I could actually use the Power Armor as much as I wanted without having to worry about it changing my size or absorbing too much damage. It was liberating. I returned to Preston, but didn’t get through enough of the dialog for them to move to Sanctuary. No, they’re staying right there in the Museum of Freedom.<br /><br />Then, I decided to do something different. I was curious about something. I had Power Armor and was going to put it to good use. I headed straight south towards the Glowing Sea. Along the way, I slapped a Raider so hard his arm exploded, I got into a fight with some Ghouls, then decided to run the swear word away, leaving Dogmeat to deal with them. I fought even more Ghouls, this time a little more successfully. I got into a bit of a scuffle with a group of Raiders, resulting in both my legs being broken and a lot of my ammo being wasted. I did get a Missile Launcher, though. A short time later, my only Fusion Core ran out of juice. I ditched the armor, took some Rad-X, and managed to survive the Glowing Sea and arrive at Virgil’s Cave. I was hoping I’d be able to skip a lot of the game, but Virgil was nowhere to be found. Still, this will save me a lot of effort down the line.<br /><br />The search for my son was once again my number two priority. On a bridge north of somewhere, I killed a doctor and took her supplies. She had 9 Stimpaks and I didn’t. I could not just let the slide. That leveled me up, and at Level 5, I finally put the first point into Scrounger. Don’t ask why I waited so long. This was the perk that I really needed because ammo is really the only concern in this run. Weapons and Armor don’t need to be repaired and Stimpaks can become stupid powerful pretty early on, so keeping a solid supply of bullets was all I was really worried about. <br /><br />...
