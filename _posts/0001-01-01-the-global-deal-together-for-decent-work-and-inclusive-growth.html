The Global Deal is a Swedish initiative that addresses challenges in the world’s labour market and aims to extend the benefits of globalization to all people. It is an international, multistakeholder partnership that engages governments, labour organizations, businesses and other groups to enhance the dialogue on issues of social and economic policy. Greater equality and increased growth can be achieved through mutual respect, trust and collaboration between employers, workers and governments.<br /> <br />Sofia Ösmark, ambassador and coordinator of the Global Deal, spoke at the CIGI Global Policy Forum in Ottawa on September 21, 2017. The CIGI Global Policy Forum is an exclusive series of talks offering authoritative analysis on policy-relevant issues affecting Canada and its place in the world through a wide range of distinguished speakers.
