Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mathswrap.co.uk">http://www.mathswrap.co.uk</a> for real maths, tips and techniques.<br /><br />This video is all about how to simplify an algebra fraction and forms part of the playlist 'Answers to tough questions.' It's generally an A / A* grade GCSE and would probably be around 3 marks. <br /><br />The issue with all addition and subtraction of fractions is to make sure that the bottom number - the lowest common denominator is the same. The question is fairly straightforward to get the LCM and then you need to work through each term to ensure that they are equivalent fractions. <br /><br />(3x)/(4)-(x+2)/(3)+(x+2)/(12) is a little difficult to write in the description but I hope you'll get the idea from the video on how to simplify an algebra fraction. There are a number of other videos and I'll add annotations to this so you can access them. <br /> <br />I hope the video helps and please do leave a comment - thanks!<br /><br />My new course ‘How to good at mathematics - and great at fractions! is now live on Udemy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/how-you-can-be-good-at-maths-and-great-at-fractions/">https://www.udemy.com/how-you-can-be-good-at-maths-and-great-at-fractions/</a>  <br />or click here for a limited 50% discount!:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.udemy.com/how-you-can-be-good-at-maths-and-great-at-fractions/?couponCode=MathsWrap">http://www.udemy.com/how-you-can-be-good-at-maths-and-great-at-fractions/?couponCode=MathsWrap</a> <br /><br />The course contains around 3 hours of video, quizzes and a copy of my book 'How to get an A in maths.'
