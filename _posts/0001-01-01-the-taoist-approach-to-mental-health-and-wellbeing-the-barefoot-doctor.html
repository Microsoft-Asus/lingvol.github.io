{% raw %}The Barefoot Doctor, Stephen Russell is an acclaimed and controversial interpreter of the philosophy and the methods of the ancient Taoist warrior-sages. Working across all platforms he teaches how these may be best deployed to ameliorate the human condition from the inside out. He's dedicated nearly 50 years to his specialty, has authored 17 books, including HANDBOOK FOR THE URBAN WARRIOR, produces 'psychoactive' electronic dance music, and founded the 'conscious clubbing' movement. He is an avid bridge-builder between the worlds of esoteric study and contemporary culture and has a following of millions around the world.<br /><br />www.barefootdoctorglobal.com<br />@BarefootDoctor<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
