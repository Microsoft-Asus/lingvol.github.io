{% raw %}A typically good episode following an overloaded, top-heavy truck nicknamed the Warthog as it creeps agonisingly slowly along 650 kilometres of boggy mud tracks in the Congo. The journey was only supposed to take a few days but the roads turn out to be much worse even than they usually are - at times the Warthog passes whole convoys of other trucks hopelessly stuck in the mire. If anyone's more worried than the driver about the state of affairs, it's probably all the passengers who have paid to travel on top of all the cargo piled high in the back of the truck. There are some sights to see on the way, such as the abandoned mine in which locals work underground with crowbars, bare hands and no safety equipment to fill bags of ore that sell for a pittance to Chinese and Indian traders. -<br /><br />Follow us on social media :<br />Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BestDocumentaryTV">https://www.facebook.com/BestDocumentaryTV</a>{% endraw %}
