Today AD is welcomed by Hilary Duff for a tour of her vibrant family home. A sunny vibe radiates through every room of the Duff household, a feeling curated across two renovations of the space in the past 8 years. Featuring walls packed with pictures of her family, shelves filled with her children’s toys and friendly pets popping up to say hello, Hilary’s home is a cheerful reminder of what matters most in life. Case in point - a typical day includes tending to the chickens in her outdoor coop, enjoying the sunshine, while her son Luca bounces on the backyard trampoline.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Select artwork by Nicole Patel.<br /><br />Want even more AD?
