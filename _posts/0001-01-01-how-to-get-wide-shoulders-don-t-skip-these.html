Ready to blow up those side delts? Let's get after it!<br /><br />I've had a few people ask me to go over all of the lateral raise variations you can do and while this ins't all of them, these are some of my favorite. I figured I would spare you a 15min video because you know.. So if you want to hit that lateral head effectively I would take a day and try each one of these exercises and see which you connect with most. I guarantee there will be one that becomes you new staple and helps you put some serious size on those delts.<br /><br />Also, If this channel has helped you and you want to support it then check out Ryse and use promo code &quot;RYAN&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rysesupps.com/ryan">https://rysesupps.com/ryan</a><br /><br />#shoulders #sidedelts #dumbbells
