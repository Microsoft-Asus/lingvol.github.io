{% raw %}What is Communication?<br />Common Communication Theories have been developed a long time ago and refer to the interaction of human beeings. <br /><br />However, in the world we live in today we mostly interact with computers and start to increasingly face former futuristic things like artificial intelligence and such. <br /><br />So is communication really only limited on human communication? Or should it include the interaction of humans and computers as well?<br /><br />And how about the interaction of humans and companies?<br /><br />What do you think?
