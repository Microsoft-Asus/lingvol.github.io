G-Shocks are well known as being exceptionally tough; in fact, their ethos is that they are the “toughest watches of all time”. But what if you need something even tougher than a standard G-Shock?!<br /><br />That’s where the new G-Steel range comes into play, with a steel construction and carbon core guard structure. You thought standard G-Shocks are tough? This is on a whole other level.<br /><br />On top of that, it’s got many tricks up its sleeve: solar power, 200m WR, bluetooth connectivity, dual time, timer, stopwatch, alarm.<br /><br />Costing £349, the price may come as a bit of a (G-)shock, but it's certainly a lot of watch.
