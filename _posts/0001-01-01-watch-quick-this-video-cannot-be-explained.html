They were created to ensure we left a piece of our existence for our future generations to see.<br />Unfortunately, cameras can also capture things they did not intend to. From, the weird, to the creepy, to the downright incomprehensible, cameras truly make us believe that there’s more to life than what meets the eye.<br />With that being said, let’s take a look at 10 of the most unexplainable moments caught on camera.<br />10. An Unexplained Shadow in the Water<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VFFUyHJ3Cc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VFFUyHJ3Cc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayAKsgObmlI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayAKsgObmlI</a><br />The mysteries of the sea, how will we solve them all? Yes, it is home to some of the creepiest creatures lurking in the deep. We’ve heard of nightmares like the fangtooth fish and the giant squid. We’ve even heard stories of ghoulish creatures like the Kraken swimming the deep blue. But could there be truths to these mysteries?<br />Take for example this video here that captured a weird creature meandering eerily in the cold ocean waters of Alaska. Could this be a prehistoric dinosaur trapped in the wrong timeline? Could it have survived the numerous mass extinctions that have rocked our planet over the course of millions of years? While some viewers agreed that its movements exhibited that of a foreign foreign creature not documented in our fossil records, others consider this video a fake. One overwhelming evidence is the formation of ice on the creature’s back. No creature would allow ice to form in such a manner; whether warm blooded or cold blooded. Unless perhaps they are some foreign creature not of this planet? You be the judge of that and let us know in the comment sections below.<br />9. Ghost in The Tower of Terror<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zgjY4syL2c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zgjY4syL2c</a><br />Disneyland has had its share of mysteries. As one of the most beautiful and wonderful places to visit, Disneyland can be somewhat creepy at times. While children love the place, adults might spot a few things that will make them wonder.Yes, it can also be home to some paranormal activities that will truly shock and amaze you. Let’s look at this footage here, for example. You can see one of Disney’s maintenance technicians carrying out a service check in the famous, or shall we say, infamous Tower of Terror ride. Of course, if anything creepy was bound to happen in  Disneyland, it would most likely take place here, right?<br />Yes, the technician thought he was alone...but it turns out that’s not the case:<br />As you can see, a weird flicker of static shows that there is a silhouette a few paces from the engineer. But he does not notice it. He is so focused on the task at hand that nothing seems to phase him. A few seconds later, it appears right next to him; yet again, he is not phased.. Could it be a ghost just fooling around with him? We’ll never know; but one thing’s for sure, this engineer takes his work very seriously.<br />8. Gollum or Alien?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kW6DuaKwZQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kW6DuaKwZQ</a><br />CCTV cameras have certainly made the world a safer place. Indeed, you can sleep safely knowing that your camera is watching your property; especially the driveway where robbers love to take advantage of parked vehicles.. But what happens when your security camera records something unexpected? Something that borders alien propaganda?<br />This is exactly what one woman in Colorado woke up to find the next morning when she decided to see what her security camera has been recording. Deep in the night, some weird creature walks creepily past her camera. The creature looks emaciated, and has elf-like ears. Some people actually think that it could be a magical elf, like in Harry Potter, or a weird creature, like Gollum. On the other hand, some viewers believe that the creature could finally be the first sighting of an actual alien captured on camera. Nevertheless, there are skeptics who believe that the video is a hoax; and it’s really just a child wearing underwear over his head. But if that’s really the case, then we have a few questions to ask.<br />First of all, why does the child look so emaciated? Even if it’s a prank, why are his parents starving him? Secondly, why does the child have such awkward and weird movements? He is literally walking and prancing about as if he has nails on his feet. <br />Nonetheless, this video is a bone-chilling reminder that you never know what you’ll find in the darkness. So better keep safe!
