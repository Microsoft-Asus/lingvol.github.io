Hey, guys! Today Kylene want to share with you her sad story.<br />&quot;My family is rich. My dad runs his own business. He has a travel agencies network. My mom stays at home. She is responsible for my education. She’s cool, loving and understanding. We were always together with her, like best friends. And dad was our knight and defender – he protected us from all the problems. That’s what mom said.
