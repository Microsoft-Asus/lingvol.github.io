Using Motion 5, Blender, Final Cut Pro X, Garageband and iMovie to create a futuristic HUD / sci fi computer screen / telemetry readout.... Some of the sound effects are from the opening scene in the movie 'Alien' when the computer boots up, very cool sounds, hard to create (for me at least)... Just used this as an editing exercise
