{% raw %}What are the elements of a robust financial plan for your family, that can thrive in good times, and withstand the bad times?<br /><br />Guest Speakers:<br />1. Gunaseelan Kannan, CFP &amp; Licensed Financial Planner ‚Äì Blueprint Planning<br />2. Inderjit Singh, CFP<br /><br />Moderators<br />1. Roshan Kanesan ‚Äì Producer/Presenter, BFM Ringgit &amp; Sense<br />2. Malek Ali ‚Äì Founder, Fi Life<br />____________<br />Show Notes: <br /> <br />1. Basics of Family Financial Planning 1:28 4:21 6:25<br />- Life Value and Monetary Value:<br />   - What is the aspiration of the family (what they want to achieve, experience) <br />   - The culture, risk-taking habits and spending behaviour <br />- It is an inclusive plan that involves the children and spouse in the discussion (this is how it is different from an individual financial plan) - the financial struggle is shared by all members of the family, can create a stronger bond <br />- Risk management: most families did not take into consideration unexpected deaths or accidents<br />- Malek has a family assets spreadsheet that is shared with his wife <br />- He does not disclose the exact figure of how much he earns to his children but gives them context<br /><br />2. Priorities in terms of financial commitment 8:55 19:15<br />- Question to ask ourselves, what's important in our life so we can identify priorities<br />- Financial Goal: set a financial goal before a financial plan. We often get lost in the action of investing without knowing what is our goal<br />-Cash Flow Management: without knowledge of income and expenses, difficult to make financial decisions<br />- Plan for the worst, get your family protected then you can have peace of mind to grow your investments<br /><br />3. Common Mistakes in Financial Planning 16:44 <br />- Lifestyle inflation: as income increases, spending also increases<br />- Different opinions on big purchases, or who should manage the finance<br />- Emergency fund &amp; immediate obligation funds are often missed out<br />- Financial plans should also be flexible so one can always reduce lifestyle expenses<br /><br />4. Engaging a Financial Planner 12:21<br />- One can be emotional about their own money, an independent financial planner is able to help you identify your weaknesses and strengths<br />- Ask if the financial planner is representing you or the financial advisory company; how they are compensated, whether open to disclose the commission amount from products sold<br /><br />5. Protecting the family 22:40 <br />- Insurance as a form of protection and savings are equally important<br />- Buy term life insurance to save cost and invest the rest<br />- Look at what‚Äôs the worst that can happen and the context of the family<br />- Malek prioritises protection in the early days to make sure the family does not suffer should there be any accidents but switch to investment focus in the later years <br /><br />6. Estate Planning 28:53 <br />- Very important for new parents with young children <br />- Without a will, estates can be frozen for a long time  <br />- Essential components in a will:<br />a. Appointment of an executor <br />b. Young children - appoint a guardian in case of common tragedy <br />c. 2 independent witnesses<br />- Life insurance for the estate to manage liabilities<br />- High net worth individual can have a trust to mitigate risk so your estates can be well preserved <br />- Use a trust structure while you are still alive to protect assets from bankruptcy<br />- The family fund is already put aside and will not be affected by the bankruptcy<br />- Minimum of RM1,500 to set up an insurance trust, living trust from RM 5000<br /><br />7. Financial planning for young graduates 36:24 <br />- Cultivate the habit to put away 10% of your pay <br />- Save before spend<br />- Start small and build it up over time <br />- With a RM 1,500 salary, you can still save RM 200. <br />- As your income grows, put aside funds for emergency and immediate needs<br />- Do you spend or invest your bonus (lump sum of money)?<br />- Don't spend too much on your wedding <br />- Increase your financial literacy level, learn from the financial bloggers out there <br />- Learn to differentiate real investments or speculative ones.
