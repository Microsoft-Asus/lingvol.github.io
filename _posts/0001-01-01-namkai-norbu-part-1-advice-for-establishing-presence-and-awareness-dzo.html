At five, he was also recognized as a mindstream emanation of an emanation of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594‚Äì1651). From an early age, Namkhai Norbu undertook an accelerated course of study, attending monastic college, taking retreats, and studying with renowned teachers, including some of the most important Tibetan masters of his time.<br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />üôè May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.<br />Every day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.<br /><br />Turn on the 'üîî' to get notifications for new releases! <br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />üîÜ Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
