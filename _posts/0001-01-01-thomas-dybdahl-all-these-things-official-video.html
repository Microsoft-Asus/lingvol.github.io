{% raw %}In connection with the release of my newest single “All These Things” I am so proud to present this live version recorded in The Village, May 2018. Listen to the original version here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://TDybdahl.lnk.to/AllTheseThings">https://TDybdahl.lnk.to/AllTheseThings</a><br /> <br />We didn’t have a video for the single and I wasn’t really that keen on making a normal music video so we thought why not shoot a live version instead. This turned out to be a whole session and I can’t wait to show it all later this year. For now, this is the single, flanked by a pretty remarkable group of musicians:<br /> <br />Guitar - Dean Parks​<br />Drums - James Gadson​<br />Bass - Dan Lutz​<br />Keys - Patrick Warren​<br />Vocals - Lera Lynn​<br />Vocals &amp; guitar - Myself<br />Produced by Larry Klein<br />Mixed by Tchad Blake<br /> <br />The video is directed by Richard Hutchison​{% endraw %}
