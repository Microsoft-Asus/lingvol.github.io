Showing you the Winter Cab View from two of the most SCENIC RAILWAYS in the World - The Bergen Line and the Famous FlÃ¥m Railway. Usually these lines are known for their summer imagery, but they look amazing in a different way during winter.<br /><br />This is a pre-recorded playlist due to liability and safety reasons. I work as a Traind Driver/operator/engineer on the Bergen Line and FlÃ¥m Line, and I'm giving you a virtual train travel riding in the seat next to me in the drivers cab.
