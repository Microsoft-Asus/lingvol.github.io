What are interest rates?<br /><br />Interest rates, however, are important to understand because of their profound effects on your stock portfolio and your ability to buy a house. This impact is so significant that the chairman of the Fed Reserve is probably the second most powerful person in the country after the President.<br /><br />Interest rates generally refer to the general level of interest that a borrower has to pay a lender to borrow a certain amount of money for a certain amount of time. These rates refer to all sorts of loans, ranging from ones companies take to buy new machines, to ones you or I would take to buy a new house.  Although these loans can be used by very different borrowers for very different purposes, their overall levels generally rise and fall together. Think of a rising tide lifting all boats in the water, regardless of whether itâ€™s a tanker or a rowboat. Intuitively, high interest rates dissuade people from borrowing because it becomes more expensive to do so.<br /><br />Want a FREE STOCK when you sign up for a brokerage account?
