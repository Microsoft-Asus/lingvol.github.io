New Age is on the rise. There are even forms of new age christianity. It teaches us (like mormonism) that we can become gods. But this is obviously a false teaching. <br /><br />Derek Prince states it very clearly: 'We are created, God is uncreated. The created can never become uncreated'. <br /><br />This is a clip from the full sermon 'Laying The Foundation - Part 2'. Full video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BU8G4JG7F8M">https://youtu.be/BU8G4JG7F8M</a>   <br /><br />4161, recorded in New Zealand, December 1994
