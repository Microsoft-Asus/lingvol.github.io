{% raw %}In 2021 Toyota is going to introduce a supper EV battery, which is going to be a big game-changer in the automotive industry as it's going to charge in 10 minutes, reports Nikkei Asian Review.<br /><br />&quot;The technology is a potential cure-all for the drawbacks facing electric vehicles that run on conventional lithium-ion batteries, including the relatively short distance traveled on a single charge as well as charging times. Toyota plans to be the first company to sell an electric vehicle equipped with a solid-state battery in the early 2020s. The world's largest automaker will unveil a prototype next year,&quot; reads Nikkei Asia referring to Toyota's upcoming solid-state EV battery.<br /><br />The article also says upcoming Toyota electric vehicles will have a range more than twice the distance of a vehicle running on a conventional lithium-ion battery under the same conditions. &quot;All accomplished without sacrificing interior space in even the most compact vehicle,&quot; writes Nikkei.<br /><br />A solid-state battery is a battery technology that uses solid electrodes and a solid electrolyte, instead of the liquid or polymer gel electrolytes found in lithium-ion or lithium polymer batteries. Solid-state batteries are expected to become a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries that use aqueous electrolyte solutions. These batteries lower the risk of fires and multiply energy density. Thus, this new solid-state battery by Toyota could also be a good alternative to LFP batteries, which are cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, but have less energy density.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Japanese government is also helping Toyota, putting together a fund of 19.2 billion US dollars to support decarbonization in Japan. &quot;The Japanese government has been encouraging the domestic development of solid-state batteries, under the outlook that most of the technology relating to automotive performance will depend on China if the status quo holds,&quot; reports Nikkei.<br /><br />Toyota has nearly 1,000 patents involving Solid-State batteries.<br /><br />#ToyotaBattery<br />#ToyotaSolidStateBattery<br />#Toyota<br />#ToyotaEV<br /><br />This is Armen Hareyan from Torque News.
