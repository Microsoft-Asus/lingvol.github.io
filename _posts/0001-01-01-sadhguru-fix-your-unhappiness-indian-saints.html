Happy people don’t try for happiness. They don’t look for it. Happy people become happy as a side note to living their life the best way they can. Chronically unhappy people seem to want to fix their unhappiness and in doing so miss the mark all together. Happiness can’t be chased. It can’t be found. It can’t be grasped. It happens, when everything else falls into place.<br /><br />The purpose of This video is to demonstrate and conceptualize specific. We Transform clips to create a creatively unique vision and giving new meaning. All the graphics used in videos are created  by our team in various video editing software's like Adobe Premiere Pro &amp; Sony Vegas and other. We've transformed the original work by adding Our own unique value such as added high-quality edits, background effects and special effects, Storyline and Commentary to create completely new, original video. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.<br /><br />You can’t fix unhappiness, unless you fix your inner dormant self. Wake up inside and make some changes. Happiness is grossly related to our actions, our choices and ultimately our thoughts. You can feel happy only as much as your mind will allow you. Fix your thoughts. Stretch your mind. Stretch your capacity to feel better.<br /><br />• Footage licensed through: <br />  Videoblocks <br /><br />• Speakers: <br />  Sadhguru<br /><br />• Copyright disclaimer:<br />  We own a commercial license for all the content used in this video.<br /><br />Our Social Media Links <br />Subscribe Us on Youtube :-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0eswHzCn9XablGY4LEvRgQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0eswHzCn9XablGY4LEvRgQ</a><br />Follow us on Facebook :-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fb.com/Indian-Mystic-Yogi-Sadhguru-103351898248764">http://fb.com/Indian-Mystic-Yogi-Sadhguru-103351898248764</a><br />Follow Us on Twitter :-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/saints_indian">https://twitter.com/saints_indian</a><br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br />* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
