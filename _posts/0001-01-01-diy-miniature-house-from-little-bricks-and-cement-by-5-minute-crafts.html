We are building an architectural masterpiece from scratch using cement, wood, and other tools.<br />We see miniatures everywhere, from teeny tiny model appliances in various department stores to architectural models and even dollhouses. Building a small home isn't an easy task. It requires a lot of patience, precision, imagination, and creativity.  We wanted to test this new challenge and try to build our own miniature architectural masterpiece from scratch. <br /> First, we started with the foundation of the house. We wanted to make it sturdy by adding multiple foam board sheets to the base and give it some height. Who wouldn't love a miniature home with a pool? After that, we continued the construction with some wires and cement. <br />Then it was time for the walls; we cut out the windows and doors and left a thin gap between the outer and inner foam boards to fill them with cement. Once the house's exterior walls were done, we took out our miniature bricks and started with the inner walls. <br />Watch until the end of the video to see how we made the furniture from scratch and how beautiful our little staircase is. <br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/">https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/">https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/5m_crafts">https://twitter.com/5m_crafts</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fWbJqz">https://goo.gl/fWbJqz</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PEuLVt">https://goo.gl/PEuLVt</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2S69VUG">http://bit.ly/2S69VUG</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The Bright Side of Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me">http://www.brightside.me</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a>
