The music of the Persona series is some of my favorite stuff ever, so I thought it would be cool to reimagine a Persona 4 track as if it was a part of Persona 5's OST - Enjoy!<br /><br />I produced this arrangement based on both the version of the song in the original P4 OST and the remixed version in the &quot;Reincarnation&quot; album, using &quot;Life Goes On&quot; from P5 as a base for the sound I was trying to achieve. Persona 3 fans may notice a familiar phrase somewhere in here too ;)<br /><br />Stream this track: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://song.link/i/1526373297">https://song.link/i/1526373297</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RohanAdiyodi">https://twitter.com/RohanAdiyodi</a><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br />- this arrangement recorded/produced by me<br />- original version composed by Shoji Meguro<br />- Reincarnation version arranged by Atsushi Kitajoh
