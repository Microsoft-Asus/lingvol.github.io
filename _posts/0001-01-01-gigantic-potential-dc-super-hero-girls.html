Full of muscles and attitude - you already know who she is. Witness Giganta's best moments right here!<br /><br />Wonder Woman™, Supergirl™ and the rest of the DC Super Hero Girls™ come together in an all-new action-packed paperback series: Winner Takes All, available now. <br /><br /><br /><br />A new era of DC Super Hero Girls begins in DC Super Hero Girls: At Metropolis High! Graphic Novel, available now.<br /><br /><br /><br />Available on Cartoon Network and Netflix in the U.S.! <br /><br /><br /><br />Saving the day is super easy when you’re a Super Hero. But stopping evil in its tracks while keeping up grades and managing a social life, all before curfew? Ugh. That’s, like, super tough. DC Super Hero Girls are more than crime-fighting besties, they’re a diverse group of dedicated super-teens! Working together, they fight the battles of Metropolis and the battles of growing, up all at the same time. Always discovering new ways to control their powers and abilities, these awesome girls are quickly learning (sometimes the hard way) how to deal with the super challenges of being a teenage Super Hero.<br /><br /><br /><br />We all have the power to make a difference. Just make sure to use it for good or you’ll find yourself up against those tenacious teens, the DC Super Hero Girls.<br /><br /><br /><br />#DCSuperHeroGirls #KidsCartoons<br /><br /><br /><br />MORE VIDEOS HERE ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dcsuperherogirls">https://www.youtube.com/c/dcsuperherogirls</a> <br /><br />MORE GAMES &amp; ACTIVITIES HERE ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dckids.com/super-hero-girls">https://www.dckids.com/super-hero-girls</a><br /><br /><br /><br />All DC related characters and elements © &amp; ™DC Comics.
