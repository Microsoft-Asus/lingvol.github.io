{% raw %}We love train travel! It seems like you never know what you're going to get, and this was no exception! We took an overnight train in &quot;first class&quot; or what the Norwegians call a &quot;private compartment&quot; from Oslo to Stavanger, Norway. The journey took about 9 hours total. ✈️ We created FareDrop to help you score super cheap international flights!

We started “travel hacking” &amp; finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :){% endraw %}
