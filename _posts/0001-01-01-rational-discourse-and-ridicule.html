{% raw %}This video is about whether ridicule has a place in rational discourse. It isn't a simple yes or no answer, but instead depends on the context of the ridicule. A lot of people commonly will use the existence of ridicule in an argument as a way to disregard the argument as a whole, but as this video will explain that is itself a disruption to public discourse.    <br /><br />Discourse - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse</a><br /><br />Flowchart for a Rational Discourse - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.anandavala.info/STAR/flowchart.html">http://www.anandavala.info/STAR/flowchart.html</a><br /><br />Communicative rationality - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_rationality">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_rationality</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Subscribe for regular videos!<br />Like this video and share it around!<br /><br />Follow us on Facebook - (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/therationalchannel/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel)">https://www.facebook.com/therationalchannel/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel)</a><br />Also follow us on Twitter (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/YouTube_TRC)">https://twitter.com/YouTube_TRC)</a><br /><br />Thanks again for watching<br />- R &amp; J{% endraw %}
