How we’d all love the excess inches on our waist to go away all by themselves... But wait! Don’t fret — it’s entirely possible!<br />Bright Side has found several alternative ways to lose those extra pounds without going to the gym or dieting like crazy.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />Contrast shower 0:42<br />Massage 1:40<br />Breathing 2:21<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />- The main rule of breathing gymnastics is that you should breathe in and out not with your chest but with your stomach. A thin waist ripped abs, strong abdominal muscles — everything’s possible if you do the whole set of breathing exercises.<br />- When finishing a shower, make the water in turns icy cold and hot. Such a contrast shower will not only get rid of excess weight but also chase away such diseases as arrhythmia, obesity, vegetovascular dysfunction, primary hypertension, and cellulite. <br />- The best types of massage to fight fat are cupping, water, honey, and pinching ones. They help fraction the fat deposits, improve blood circulation in the front of your abdomen, and normalize intestinal motility. You can perform these procedures both yourself at home and in special salons. They should be done systematically and by cycles.<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC ">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC </a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
