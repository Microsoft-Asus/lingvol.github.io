Film Analysis | Memento – Distorting Reality<br /><br />In this film Analysis I will be dissecting the 2000 Neo-noir Psychological Thriller, directed by Christopher Nolan based on the short story ‘Memento Mori’ written by his brother Jonathan Nolan.  <br /><br />I will be focusing on how Memento distorts reality within the film, and how it distorts Leonard’s perception of what’s real and what isn’t. We will be looking at the film structure, characters and themes and explore how reality is distorted within the film through it's editing. <br /><br />Also, note, I won’t be focusing heavily on the Sammy Jankis storyline, it is the most important aspects of the film, however it has been covered in other video analysis, and it’s is self-explanatory in the confrontation scene at the end with Teddy and Leonard. I will briefly touch upon it, but I will be focusing mostly on the themes of Deception and Memory, how they are explored and how it is used to distort reality within the film.<br /><br />Video Analysis I was mentioning - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYScJZWhaHA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYScJZWhaHA</a> <br /><br />Footage from:<br /><br />- Memento (2000)<br /><br />Video edited and voiced by Cristobal Olguin<br /><br />EQUIPMENT I USE:<br /><br />- MXL Tempo USB Condenser Microphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2yg5HCt">http://amzn.to/2yg5HCt</a><br /><br />- Adobe Premiere Pro CC - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2xytytn">http://amzn.to/2xytytn</a><br /><br />- Adobe Audition CC - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2zfjoQf">http://amzn.to/2zfjoQf</a><br /><br />ENGAGE:<br /><br />Subscribe for more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW-qfTTKckZ4z8d4eV-Ndig">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW-qfTTKckZ4z8d4eV-Ndig</a><br /><br />CONNECT:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CristobalOlguinFilms/">https://www.facebook.com/CristobalOlguinFilms/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cristobalolguinfilms/">https://www.instagram.com/cristobalolguinfilms/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CristobalFilms">https://twitter.com/CristobalFilms</a><br /><br />Ghost Story by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> <br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300034">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300034</a> <br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Most of the links provided as resource links here are affiliate links that support the channel.
