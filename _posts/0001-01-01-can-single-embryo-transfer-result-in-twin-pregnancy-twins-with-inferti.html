Single embryo transfer is done with the intention of having a single pregnancy. Why do we want a single pregnancy unlike twins or triplet pregnancy. If it is a singleton pregnancy, the complications associated with pregnancy are much lesser because in twin pregnancy or triplet pregnancy, there is increase incidence  of preterm  delivery. Increased incidence of ICU admission to the babies there can be long term morbidity to the babies in the form of  problems wit the lungs,  neuronal development. In order to avoid all these things, single elective embryo transfer is the best advocated procedure.  However one has to realize  that even if single elective embryo transfer  is done, there is a possibility, not always of a twin pregnancy.  Why does this happen?  When a blastocyst or a day 5 embryo is transferred,  this blastocyts  has a tendency of  forming, not  always  of  forming monozygotic  twins. That is single blastocyst can divide into two and case twin pregnancy. However this is a very are condition, unlike when two blastocyst is  transferred. When two blastocyst is transferred, the chances of having   twin pregnancy is higher, twins and triplets is  also formed however when single blastocyst is   transferred the chances of  singleton  pregnancy is much  higher than  twins, but here are chances of having twin pregnancy, that is monozygotic  twins.<br />#InfertilityTreatment<br />#C9HealthTalk <br />#CloudnineHospitals <br />#IVF<br />#IUI<br />#Infertility
