{% raw %}This video runs through some of the different options to keep your partner in Australia. We will discuss the Onshore Partner Visa, Offshore Partner Visa, NZ Citizen FamilyMember 461, Prospective Marriage Visa and also including your partner onto your current visa.<br /><br />Relevant Links:<br />✔ Partner Visas: pathwaytoaus.com/services/partner-visa-in-australia/<br />✔  Including your partner on Student visa: pathwaytoaus.com/blog/can-i-add-my-partner-to-my-student-visa/<br />✔  Australian Visas: pathwaytoaus.com/visas-to-australia/<br /><br />Onshore Partner Visa – Subclass 820/801<br />If you are onshore and you have an eligible Australian citizen or permanent resident or eligible NZ citizen as your partner, you would be applying for the 820/801. <br /><br />If you are married or in a de facto relationship, you would still apply<br />for a partner visa.<br />To be able to apply for this visa you:<br /> must have a partner who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident<br /> You must be inside Australia<br /> You must meet the de facto or spousal requirement<br /><br />When you apply for the partner visa from inside Australia, you are granted a bridging visa. As soon as you apply for the visa online, you are granted a bridging visa. The bridging visa has full work rights, access to Medicare etc, and will allow you to remain in Aus until there has been a decision on your application.<br /><br />Offshore partner visa (309/100)<br />The offshore partner visa is very similar to the onshore partner visa except, you need to be offshore when applying. Consequently, you are not granted a bridging visa which would allow you to remain in Aus. <br /><br />To be able to apply for this visa you:<br /> must have a partner who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident<br /> You must be outside of Australia<br /> You must meet the de facto or spousal requirement<br /><br />Prospective Marriage Visa (Subclass 300)<br />This visa is popular for applicants who have a partner who is an Aus citizen or permanent resident, who intend to marry, who are outside Australia, however who do not meet the de facto or spousal requirement.<br /><br />For example,  if you have not been living together for a long enough period of time, if you have had a predominantly long distance relationship etc..<br />The processing time has still blown out, so expect it to take over a year.<br />Once the visa is granted, you would have 9 months to marry your partner. Once married, you would then apply for a standard partner visa<br /><br />New Zealand Citizen Family Relationship Visa - 461<br />If you have a partner who is an NZ citizen, you can still apply for a visa to Australia. Please note in order to apply for this visa you must be in a relationship that meets the de facto or spousal relationship requirement with an NZ citizen. <br /><br />Being added as a secondary applicant to your partner’s visa<br />If you have a partner who holds a valid visa to Australia (Eg – Student, employer sponsored 482 etc..) and you meet the de facto or spousal requirement, you may be able to be added as a secondary applicant to their visa. In many circumstances you actually don’t need to be listed on their original application. If you can demonstrate that the relationship developed<br />since visa grant and you now meet the de facto requirement, you can still be added.<br /><br />If you have any questions about partner visas to Australia, feel free to contact Pathway to Aus:<br /><br />W: PATHWAYTOAUS.COM<br />E: INFO@PATHWAYTOAUS.COM<br />P: +61 7 55 265 900<br />FB: FACEBOOK.COM/PATHWAYTOAUS{% endraw %}
