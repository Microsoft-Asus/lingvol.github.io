Whole others are touted as the richest in China, this man is REALLY the richest in China. he has literally thousands of investments in unlisted securities. Valued at $2 billion in the Hurun rich list, his holdings are so diverse that we will never really know for sure.<br /><br />He is certainly the biggest collector in China and please note the Lalique glass in the background as he sits on the sofa talking about Chinese art it cost at least $750,000.
