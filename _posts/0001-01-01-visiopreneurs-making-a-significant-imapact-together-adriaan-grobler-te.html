a visiopreneur is someone that sees the picture of a better tomorrow and then works hard to bring it to reality. A dreamer and a doer all in one. <br /><br />I am a visiopreneur. And Iam also an engineer and a businessman that build up a business over the last 15 years. one year back i had a liver transplant and my body, that was functional before the transplant but sick, started to heal completely. <br /><br />This made me think what will happen if a number of people forgot about themselves and become the new liver to be transplanted in a sick and broken world to bring healing to the world.<br /><br />And if a number of visiopreneurs, each with a specific purpose in life, work together we can change the world by solving for Y in the impact equation of life. Adriaan Grobler is the founder and<br />visionary leader at a local<br />engineering consulting firm.<br />Adriaan has more than 23 years of<br />extensive experience and expertise<br />in project management, planning,<br />design, and procurement and<br />construction supervision of civil<br />engineering and building projects in<br />Namibia, South Africa, Angola,<br />Zambia and Tanzania. He is a<br />registered professional civil<br />engineer and obtained his BEng<br />(Civil) degree in 1991 from the<br />University of Stellenbosch in South<br />Africa. He recently completed a<br />short course MBA as well as a<br />Diploma in Property Development<br />and Investment at UCT. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
