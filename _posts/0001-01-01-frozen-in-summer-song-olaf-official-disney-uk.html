Olaf is known for his innocent view of the world, comic personality and his ability to disassemble himself at good—and not-so-good—times. His catchy debut single will be sure to heat up the coldest of winter days.<br /> <br />Olaf makes his feature-film debut in Walt Disney Animation Studios' comedy-adventure &quot;Frozen&quot; is in UK cinemas now!<br /> <br />ABOUT &quot;IN SUMMER&quot;<br />An ode to buzzing bees, dandelion fuzz, sandy beaches and blue skies, &quot;In Summer&quot; was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez (&quot;In Transit&quot;) and Tony® Award winner Robert Lopez (&quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;). Olaf performs the number with a little help from his close associate Josh Gad (&quot;The Internship,&quot; &quot;Jobs&quot;).<br /><br />ABOUT &quot;FROZEN&quot;<br />Walt Disney Animation Studios, the studio behind &quot;Tangled&quot; and &quot;Wreck-It Ralph,&quot; presents &quot;Frozen,&quot; a stunning big-screen comedy adventure. Fearless optimist Anna (voice of Kristen Bell) sets off on an epic journey—teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) and his loyal reindeer Sven—to find her sister Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel), whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf (voice of Josh Gad), Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. <br /><br />The film is directed by Chris Buck (&quot;Tarzan,&quot; &quot;Surf's Up&quot;) and Jennifer Lee (screenwriter, &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;), who also wrote the screenplay. It is produced by Peter Del Vecho (&quot;Winnie the Pooh,&quot; &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;). Featuring original songs from Kristen Anderson-Lopez (&quot;In Transit,&quot; &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;) and Tony® winner Robert Lopez (&quot;The Book of Mormon,&quot; &quot;Avenue Q&quot;), and an original score by Christophe Beck (&quot;The Muppets,&quot; Oscar®-winning short &quot;Paperman&quot;), &quot;Frozen&quot; is in UK cinemas now!<br /><br />The Disney UK YouTube channel brings you a wealth of official video content from all the Disney movies and characters you know and love.
