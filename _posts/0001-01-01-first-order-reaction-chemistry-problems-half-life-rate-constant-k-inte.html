This chemistry video tutorial provides a basic introduction into first order reactions.  It explains how to solve first order reaction problems such as calculating the final concentration and determining how long it will take for the concentration of the reactant to reach a certain.  This video also explains how to calculate the half life of a first order reaction given the rate constant K.  It discusses the units of the rate constant k for a first order reaction and it explains how to derive the integrated rate law expression for a first order reaction using techniques in calculus such as integration by separation of variables.  This chemical kinetics tutorial contains plenty of example problems.  <br /><br />New Chemistry Video Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bka20Q9TN6M&amp;t=25s&amp;list=PL0o_zxa4K1BWziAvOKdqsMFSB_MyyLAqS&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bka20Q9TN6M&amp;t=25s&amp;list=PL0o_zxa4K1BWziAvOKdqsMFSB_MyyLAqS&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Access to Premium Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br /><br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MathScienceTutoring/">https://www.facebook.com/MathScienceTutoring/</a>
