Hey all,<br /><br />Another quick one from me. Back at base camp having a crack at building a bushcraft chair. I've wanted to have a go for ages but only now getting around to it. Nice to be back in camp after being away for over 6 weeks too. Nice to see that whoever my visitors were they respected the camp even if they did leave a trace!<br /><br />If you happen to be interested in any of the kit I use, most (but not all) of it is purchased from Amazon and I've created a storefront page where I can list all the kit I have used and recommend. Here is the link: <br /><br />www.amazon.co.uk/shop/onelifeoverland<br /><br />Hope you enjoy.<br /><br />Good luck, OLO
