I love to share my life as a teen mom to my 2-year old daughter Everly- she’s my pride and joy and loves to show off her humor and intelligence in the vlogs. I’m raising her with my large, crazy family and her loving father (we co-parent!!). My goal is to inspire my audience and show you can THRIVE as a teen mom! -Maddie<br /> <br />Music Credits:<br /> <br />Track: Jim Yosef - Fall With Me [NCS Release]<br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BG_W8Z74nG8">https://youtu.be/BG_W8Z74nG8</a><br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ncs.io/FallWithMe">http://ncs.io/FallWithMe</a>
