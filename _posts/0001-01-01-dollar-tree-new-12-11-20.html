{% raw %}Hello everyone. <br />Hope this week was a good one for all of you. <br />This weeks video is a tad shorter than most. As Christmas gets closer they seem to be most focused on gift wrap, bags, and last minute gift items.<br />Though I have noticed this week that they are starting to put out small items for Valentines like roses are being restocked, and their valentine stickers.<br />Some great finds this week in home decor and in the craft department. <br />If you like making wreaths or crafting with deco mesh, this week they have their large sized rolls out in some ombre colors. Awesome buy for just $1.<br />Thanks so much for watching I hope you all have a great weekend.<br />Rebecca, Stu &amp; The Crew{% endraw %}
