EDIT AUGUST 2, 2017: This video was removed by Google on July 28, and I was given a Community Guidelines strike for “hate speech”. No explanation was given. I appealed the decision, but I received no reply or acknowledgement. On August 2, I released a video, “Create Options”, where I referenced this video and strike. Google subsequently removed the strike and reinstated the video. I have receive no communications from Google or YT as to why it was suddenly reinstated. CRP<br /><br />Advice for young women from an old fart. <br /><br />If you like this video, please hit the like button and subscribe—but most important of all, pass this along to someone whom you think might benefit from my point of view.
