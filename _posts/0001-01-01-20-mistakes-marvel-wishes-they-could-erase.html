{% raw %}Big Mistakes Marvel Wishes They Could Take Back<br />SUBSCRIBE NOW to CBR! Click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR</a><br /><br />We all make mistakes from time to time, but when our favorite superhero franchises are the ones that make errors, we have a hard time looking past them. The MCU has been around for over ten years now, which means although the movies are awesome, gradually over time a significant amount of mistakes have built up from move to movie. Mistakes Marvel wishes they could erase, but sadly they can’t. <br /><br />Just look at the way they handled the fake Mandarin in Iron Man 3 and how the general public responded to the twist. Look at certain major plot holes like Nick Fury’s missing eye, Thanos’ infinity gauntlet, and even the general Marvel timeline presented in Spiderman: Homecoming and Captain America: Civil War. The point is, there are a lot of mistakes in MCU movies that we think need to be pointed out. We’re not overly mad at them or anything, we understand that making these movies can be difficult, but it’s still sort of funny how some of these Marvel movie mistakes slipped through the cracks without anyone noticing them. <br /><br />So today’s video is all about the biggest mistakes in Marvel movies. Check out our video below and be sure to let us know in the comments what you think is the biggest mistake in all of the MCU.
