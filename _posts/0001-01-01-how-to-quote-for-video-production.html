{% raw %}When you submit a quote for a video project, do you break down the proposal with line items, or do you just give an 'all-inclusive' total price?<br /><br />Personally, I do a combination of both by PROVIDING A SIMPLE OUTLINE OF PRODUCTION. Generally, that includes three line items: pre-production, filming, and post-production.<br /><br />Because there are so many variables with each project, I go into more detail on what's included with each phase of production. However, I never go into too many specifics with every little cost, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A NEGOTIATING WAR WITH THE CLIENT.<br /><br />YOU WANT TO HELP THE CLIENT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE WITHOUT OVERWHELMING THEM WITH THE DETAILS. So, find the balance of explaining what they are paying for but not line itemizing every little detail. <br /><br />For instance, perhaps within a normal day rate you bring certain video gear. 9 time out of 10 your client doesn't know or care about the difference in the lighting, sound, and brand names of your camera equipment. It's not necessary to confuse them with the details unless they are generally curious. LESS DETAILS IS MORE in (most cases) when you're quoting. You want to be clear and thorough, but this isn't your chance to convey the value. INSTEAD, CONVEY THE VALUE THROUGH YOUR SERVICE, PROFESSIONALISM, AND PORTFOLIO VIDEOS.<br /><br />I hope this helps, but if you have any further questions about this topic or anything else related to building a successful video production company, drop them below.{% endraw %}
