Best Music for Studying: A smooth piano music session you can use in the background to focus, to meditate, while studying, writing, coding, as your spa or relaxation music, as stress relief music, but of course also simply to enjoy.

I play, compose and record mostly calm and peaceful tunes and started sharing these here on YouTube in 2011. <br /><br />Music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a meaningful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through a day, a phase, or through life. <br /> <br />Many use my recordings and piano music sessions as background music while reading, doing mind work, to achieve better focus, while studying, while being creative, while coding or designing a product, a service or the world of tomorrow. From your comments I know that my music also works as relaxing music, spa or yoga music, or to set a calm tone at cafes, bars, lounges, in hotels and restaurants, mostly at a low volume.<br /><br />This project is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my tunes, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally quite busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for a calm and peaceful, light and positive tune, the relaxdaily way.<br /><br />Thank you for following, liking, sharing, commenting on and supporting the relaxdaily project!<br /><br /> - Michael a.k.a. relaxdaily<br /><br />Â© music &amp; video (2019): relaxdaily | relaxdaily.net<br />...you are wonderful!<br /><br />#studymusic #relaxingmusic #pianomusic
