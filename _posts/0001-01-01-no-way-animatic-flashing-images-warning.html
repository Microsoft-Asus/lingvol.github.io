• ok so uh… where to start??? flashing images warning at the start of the song but also at the last chorus for those sensitive to it <br />• anyway it’s historical Aragon! woo!!!<br />• sorta… I mean my drawing looks nothing like her most of the time and she became her own thing throughout the video<br />• there’s a plot and a subplot; <br />• if throwing the historical figures into a glimpse of the future counts as subplot then yes, …cause I wanted to blend both versions of Aragon in one song, the more traditional and modern one; <br />• neither is fully independent from the song itself as you can see<br />• the backgrounds are actually based on the Hampton Court Palace, I wanted to get the immersive vibe by putting them in a real place, aka where Henry VIII resided<br />• oof about the outfits; I was halfway done when I finally found out how gable hoods and the gowns actually look structurally (mind you, I love historical fashion videos on YouTube but they don’t show the back of anything for more than a few seconds) so I fixed some of them mid production after looking meticulously through Pinterest and going on YouTube again (and yes, I also found out those headdresses were called gable hoods and the circular ones I knew were French hoods)<br />• I wanted to have a variety of angles and perspectives but I guess I kinda gave up halfway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ lipsync looks off in weird angles ngl<br />• there’s portraits and paintings of them referenced throughout the video, thought that was fun to sprinkle in<br />• ofc I kinda wanted to include the other queens so I made them ghostly figures that break the 4th wall and appear as a Greek chorus style thing that sing backup for the queen<br />• I’m still bad with facial expressions but I am trying and I think I got the vibe right (some needed reference unfortunately)<br />• that diamond particle movement? her costume for Broadway has diamonds, thought I should probably make it a visual magical element as well, also she’s a queen, cmon!<br />• ah yes the step on me scene, needs no comment,  for I will not elaborate.<br />• he didn’t enjoy that but I know y’all probably will, …still it’s a power move, ngl<br />• on that note Henry is just copied from frame to frame since I cannot be bothered to constantly draw his ass, but hey it worked for so long amazingly enough<br />• we get it I’m lazy but I’d rather not have hip pain cause I sit too long<br />• anyway he and Catherine do react differently to Musical-Aragon, he’s more scared and she’s more in awe and vibing with the music;<br />• But they’re both confused and weirded out at what’s going on lmao<br />• in the line of metaphors and subtle nods to the lyrics – “daughters  are so easy to forget’ is sung by the maid(?) cause, y’know, the times and sexism and misogyny if u’r not rich<br />• Aragon as you can see here, is not the violent kind of angry, but I allowed her to be passive aggressive cause she deserves it, but also since in reality she’d handle it gracefully…. stilllll its fun to see somebody break occasionally <br />• Color!!! Aragon is always bright yellow with a golden hue since she never wavers, Henry goes from a dull hue to a greenish one since he’s enamored with Anne now, however, he does waver slightly in hue but eventually ends up green, signifying that he has made up his mind once and for all<br />• The undressing scene is not fully original, turns out I shared a Very similar idea with one tumblr artist I found in the middle of me making my animatic, but I still put it in since it looks cool as a transition and it differs enough that I hope they won’t be mad (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsenicbluejedi.tumblr.com/post/630136619734827008/shell-be-queen-till-the-end-of-her-life)">https://arsenicbluejedi.tumblr.com/post/630136619734827008/shell-be-queen-till-the-end-of-her-life)</a> – credit <br />• started burning out towards the end but I still finished the damn thing<br />• did the thing the other animatics did in the long nnnnnnnnnnnno way at the end, summed up the animatic in a coupla seconds <br />• uh I think das it.
