There are two types of gluten sensitivity that most doctors think about - non celiac gluten sensitivity and celiac disease.  It is well known that people with celiac suffer from malabsorption.<br /><br />There is some new information that has come out recently that shows that people with celiac disease can actually produce antibodies against a protein that prevents the breakdown of bone.  So not only can gluten contribute to the malabsorption, but it also can cause antibodies that destroy a protein that helps protect your bone.<br /><br /><br />To connect with Dr. Osborne visit:<br />On the web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drpeterosborne.com/">https://drpeterosborne.com/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DoctorPeterOsborne/">https://www.facebook.com/DoctorPeterOsborne/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/docosborne/">https://www.pinterest.com/docosborne/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/drosborne">https://www.instagram.com/drosborne</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/glutenology">https://twitter.com/glutenology</a><br /><br />*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
