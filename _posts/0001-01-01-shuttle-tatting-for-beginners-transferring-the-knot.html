I hope this video with a large shuttle and satin cord will help make the transferring of the knot more clear and easier to understand for those who are finding it difficult to get started with shuttle tatting.<br /><br />The large shuttle I am using is a &quot;Tatsy&quot; which I have modified by adding a hook.
