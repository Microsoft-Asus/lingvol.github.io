The explosion of knowledge of planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, and the results of decades of research on signatures of life - what scientists call biosignatures - have encouraged NASA to address, in a scientifically rigorous way, whether humanity is alone. Beyond searching for evidence of just microbial life, NASA now is exploring ways to search for life advanced enough to create technology.<br /><br />Technosignatures are signs or signals, which if observed, would allow us to infer the existence of technological life elsewhere in the universe. The best known technosignature are radio signals, but there are many others that have not been explored fully.
