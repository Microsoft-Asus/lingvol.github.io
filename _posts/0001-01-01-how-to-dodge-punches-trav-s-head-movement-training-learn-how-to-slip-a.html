How To Dodge Punches - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://howtofightnow.com/bobandweave-2-footwork/?utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_medium=Link%20in%20Bio&amp;utm_campaign=How%20To%20Dodge%20Punches%20-%20Trav's%20Head%20Movement%20Training%20-%20Learn%20How%20To%20Slip%20a%20Punch%20and%20Counter%20Punch">https://howtofightnow.com/bobandweave-2-footwork/?utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_medium=Link%20in%20Bio&amp;utm_campaign=How%20To%20Dodge%20Punches%20-%20Trav's%20Head%20Movement%20Training%20-%20Learn%20How%20To%20Slip%20a%20Punch%20and%20Counter%20Punch</a>  It's not hard to learn how to slip punches.  You will be amazed at how little you have to move your head in order to slip a punch.  Dodging punches doesn't have to waste a lot of energy.  You can slip punches with very small head movements and make your opponent miss easily... then you can counterpunch and completely smash his face. <br /><br />My head movement training program is fantastic. I combine boxing techniques and MMA techniques to give you the most efficient ways to make a punch miss from all martial styles.  You can get these lessons FREE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://howtofightnow.com.">http://howtofightnow.com.</a><br /><br />If you want to learn more about dodging punches and workouts to teach you head movement training, that is the place to go.  <br /><br />Have fun on the site, and post in the forum if you have any questions about slip or dodge training, or if you want to learn how NOT to dodge punches like anderson silva, go to the website.  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://howtofightnow.com">http://howtofightnow.com</a><br /><br />Boxing dodge... yes....<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://howtofightnow.com">http://howtofightnow.com</a> I have a HUGE pile off MMA technique videos which can be found free at How To Fight Now .com - The Fight Smart Training Program.<br /><br />Lot's of people want to learn how to fight, but they have no idea where to look.  You can find a lot of street fighting videos on YouTube, and a lot of videos titled &quot;how to win a street fight&quot;, but most of them are crap.  I personally don't want to learn from some dude punching a couch cushion in his back-yard, with his twitchy girlfriend holding his IPhone camera... but that's just me.  <br /><br />I created the fight smart training program to teach people how to fight with REAL TECHNIQUES that work... I gathered them in my career as a professional fighter.  If these techniques work in the cage, they will certainly work in a street fight.  A lot of times, I had these moves used against me... and it hurt.<br /><br />I don't care what your purposes are: self-defense, a personal quest, or just to be a more powerful bully... it doesn't matter.  My job is to provide you with the realest fighting moves out there, and to teach you how to fight and win every time.  Be sure to check out my website... I have far more video on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://howtofightnow.com">http://howtofightnow.com</a> than I have in my YouTube channel.... and they're free.... because I'm cool like that.  <br /><br />Check out the website and good luck learning how to punch, how to kick, how to do Jiu Jitsu, how to do Muay Thai kickboxing, and how to do any of the other Keywords that I'm trying to target by writing this channel description.
