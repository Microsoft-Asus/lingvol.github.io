Since we've passed 1 million subscribers, we thought it was a good time to do a new Q&amp;A video. It's been almost 4 years since the last one! Last week, we asked for questions on our social media and selected a handful to answer on camera.<br /><br />Reaching one million subscribers has always been something that seemed impossible or so far away, but recently we passed that milestone. It’s been a long journey and it wouldn’t be possible without our you, our viewers. Being able to see all these amazing abandoned buildings and share them online for hundreds of thousands to watch is still so surreal to us. We want to thank all of you for helping us develop the channel and get to where we are today.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theproperpeople.com">http://theproperpeople.com</a><br /><br /><br /><br />JOIN US ON:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/theproperpeople">http://facebook.com/theproperpeople</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/theproperpeople">http://twitter.com/theproperpeople</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/theproperpeople">http://instagram.com/theproperpeople</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theproperpeople">https://www.reddit.com/r/theproperpeople</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/theproperpeople">https://discord.gg/theproperpeople</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoying our videos?
