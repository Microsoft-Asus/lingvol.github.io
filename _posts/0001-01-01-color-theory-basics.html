For a more scientifically accurate and in-depth look at color theory, I recommend you watch Scott Naismith's video Colour Theory: The Truth About The Colour Wheel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jQqxN8LpGzw">https://youtu.be/jQqxN8LpGzw</a><br /><br />VISIT <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.simplearttips.com/">http://www.simplearttips.com/</a> FOR MORE ART TIPS AND TUTORIALS!<br /><br /><br />MUSIC: Excursion Weather from TAM Music Factory <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tam-music.com/mp3.html">http://tam-music.com/mp3.html</a>{% endraw %}
