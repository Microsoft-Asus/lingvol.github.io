These are VOD style videos you can watch and re-watch anytime...anywhere -- while in your jammies if you wish. This is much better than having to get all dressed up...paying $2,500 plus flights and hotel for an expensive seminar ticket to learn from someone amazing, at some event run by strangers, that costs a fortune. Instead you can enjoy these masterclass-style videos in privacy on your own for about the cost of a cup of coffee.
