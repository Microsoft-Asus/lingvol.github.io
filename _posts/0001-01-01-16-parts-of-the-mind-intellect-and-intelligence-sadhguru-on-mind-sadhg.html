He looks at four fundamental parts - the buddhi or intellect, the ahankara or identity, the manas or memory and chitta, which is pure intelligence. He explains how modern societies have given too much significance to the intellect, which has led to a skewed way of approaching life. He also explains that if we can touch chitta, we have access to the source of creation. During this conversation between Sadhguru and Jonathan Coslet, CIO of TPG Holdings and Board of Trustees member of the prestigious Menlo School in Atherton, California, the two discuss the challenges facing young people today, both social and academic. Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life and work serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.<br /><br />Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference.
