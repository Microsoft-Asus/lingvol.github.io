Mayo Clinic is the only medical center in Arizona to provide a new treatment for select patients with gastrointestinal reflux disease, or GERD, commonly known as heartburn. The treatment involves a minimally invasive surgical procedure where a small ring of magnetic beads is inserted around the end of a patient's esophagus.  Swallowing temporarily breaks the magnetic bond between the beads so that food can enter the stomach.  Magnetic attraction then causes the beads to close so acid can't find its way up into the esophagus.<br /><br />&quot;This procedure shows promise as an option for patients who do not respond well to lifestyle changes or those who want an alternative to medication,&quot;says Kristi Harold, M.D., General Surgery, Mayo Clinic in Arizona.  &quot;Left untreated, GERD can lead to Barrett's esophagus, which increases risk for esophageal cancer.&quot;<br /><br />To learn more about esophageal cancer, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mayocl.in/39KICIG">https://mayocl.in/39KICIG</a>
