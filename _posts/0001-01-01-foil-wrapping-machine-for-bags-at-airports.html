We extend these films within its elastic range, they have an elastic restoring force. Some of these films are also liable under severe strain successive still good, which is exploited for various applications. This adhesive force on itself, the most multi-layered films is built, through formulation of sticky polymers, or by mixing migrating sticky, highly viscous polyisobutylene, during film production (= extrusion reached) in the film surface layer.<br /><br />In the supermarket they are used for packaging of meat and vegetables in trays and bowls. In household using cling film to cover bowls and for wrapping food. Cling films on PVC basis have the advantage that drop formation is avoided and no condensation forms on the film due to their polarity. In the supermarket this is anti fog property of the film very much appreciated, otherwise the packaging unit by water misting (drops) can be unsightly.<br /><br />Cling films are also on the basis of polyethylene produced. The expert speaks of agricultural stretch film with the aid of conserved animal feed are produced by lactic acid fermentation. The good extensibility and adhesiveness of the film enables this crucial airtight packaging of silage. The film thickness is 25 microns, the roll widths are 500 mm or 750 mm, depending on the used silage stretch machine.<br /><br />Depending on the daily volume range, the range is backed up manually with hand-stretch film machine or machines with stretch film wrappers (= stretch wrapper, stretch equipment, stretch equipment). To use this get a maximum of 20 kg rolls, which are processed to semi and fully automatic stretch systems. In the beverage industry, fully automatic stretch systems are usually an integral part of the bottling plant.<br /><br />Stretch winders are available in different designs and price ranges, semi- to fully automatic, for the horizontal and vertical Pallets, the expert speaks of &quot;stretch wrapping&quot;. Stretch film in roll widths 100-250 mm are used for bundling long transport goods.<br /><br />Perforated (macro-perforated) stretch film is used to secure pallets where air circulation is required (plants, cardboard has yet to dry it, in an autoclave sterilized canning). A more exotic applications, the range of bondage, but also the protection of luggage at airports. With a consumption of 1.5 million tons per year in Europe, is in stretch film to a mass product of the European foil industry.<br /><br />The automatic winders, unlike those semi-automatic include a conveyor system to automatically load the machine and automated systems for applying, seal and cut the film. They are used for high production. The stretch film is also used in airports, at the request of interested travelers. to pack the hold baggage processing of the planes, so as to reduce the possibility of damage due to accidental opening or infiltration of moisture and to discourage theft.<br /><br />Rotating platform: the load to be wrapped is placed on a turntable which enables the load to rotate while the stretch film reel, which positioned in a trolley able to move vertically along a &quot;riser&quot; fixed, envelops it. The winding is obtained by the combined action of these two elements by rotating the load at a speed greater than the film.<br /><br />Rewinder rotating arm: in this system the reel of film is positioned on a trolley that slides vertically along the rotating arm. The load REMAINING still while the machine arm rotates around the load wrapping. These winders are able to reach very high production capacity. Wrapper rotating ring: The stretch film reel is positioned on a carriage which slides along a horizontal ring. in this system the load remains stationary while the ring rotates around the horizontal moving vertically. These winders are able to reach very high production.<br /><br />The word luggage is used to denote a variety of goods which can carry on a person. In a literal sense, it is usually a briefcase, purse or backpack which they bring when they travel. The word luggage is originally from the Old French. The word &quot;bague&quot; that &quot;bundle&quot; does, however, stems from the Germanic origins.<br /><br />Thank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!
