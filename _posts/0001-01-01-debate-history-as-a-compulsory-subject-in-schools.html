{% raw %}A ministerial task team has recommended that history should be introduced as a compulsory subject from grades 10 to matric. <br />Learners in lower grades are already obliged to take history. <br />The task team led by Professor Sibusiso Ndlovu was established in 2015. It was asked to conduct a comparative global study on how best to implement the introduction of history as a compulsory subject in grades 10, 11 and 12.  The team says that history should be enhanced, as it offers problem-solving and analytical skills. <br />Its report has recommended that history be phased in from 2023 with the process leading to the phasing out of Life Orientation. <br /><br />To discuss we're joined by the spokesperson for the Department of Basic Education, Elijah Mhlanga and from our Pretoria studio, we're joined by Dr. Mogamat Noor Davids from the Educational Foundations Department at UNISA. <br /><br />For more news, visit: sabcnews.com{% endraw %}
