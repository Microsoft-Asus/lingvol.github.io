Howell under seal, in order to obtain permission to review certain attorney-client communications prosecutors believed proved potential &quot;criminal activity.&quot; A filter team working on behalf of the government was going through several terabytes of data they had seized from over 50 electronic devices, such as iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and hard drives.&quot;<br /><br />#TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks
