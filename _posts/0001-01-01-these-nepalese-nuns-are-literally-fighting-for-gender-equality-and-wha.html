For example, the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Gender Gap Index surmised that school attendance for girls and boys was more or less equal, but that men still outstrip women in literacy rates by 24 percent, as only 47 percent of women in the country can read. There is one group of women, however, who are fighting hard to buck this trend.<br /><br />But they’re not activists or feminist intellectuals. In fact, they’re nuns who belong to the 800-year-old Drukpa sect of Buddhism. The most widely-practiced religion in Bhutan, Drukpa is popular throughout Himalayan areas.
