{% raw %}&quot;I'm On My Way&quot; from Rhiannon Giddens' album 'there is no Other' with Francesco Turrisi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/thereisnoother">http://smarturl.it/thereisnoother</a><br /><br />Directed by: Laura Sheeran<br />Filmed at: William Lane Recording Studios - Dublin, Ireland<br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/">http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.francescoturrisi.com/">http://www.francescoturrisi.com/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nonesuch.com/">http://www.nonesuch.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Lyrics<br />I’m watching from my window the curtain coming down<br />A blue as black as warning, a silence like a sound<br />That rattles at the cages that hold my heart and mind<br />That call my name to wonder, just what I hope to find<br />That bird so high above the fray, what should he mean<br />to me<br />His crooked song gone crazy in the swaying arms of trees<br />That wave to me like the hungry waiting for the tide<br />My tipping boat still hoping I might reach the other side<br />I don’t know where I’m going<br />But I’m on my way<br />Lord if you love me<br />Keep me I pray<br />A little bird is stretching out to the shimmering, shaking blue<br />Don’t know where I’m going<br />But I know what to do<br />I don’t know the hour that finds me in this room<br />Dust around my feet and still no sugar in my spoon<br />But I’ve only got the taste for something sweet as time<br />Not bottled on the table but still hanging on the vine<br />I don’t know where I’m going<br />But I’m on my way<br />Lord if you love me<br />Keep me I pray<br />A little bird is stretching out to the shimmering, shaking blue<br />Don’t know where I’m going<br />But I know what to do<br />Don’t know where I’m going<br />But I know what to do<br /><br />#rhiannongiddens #thereisnoOther{% endraw %}
