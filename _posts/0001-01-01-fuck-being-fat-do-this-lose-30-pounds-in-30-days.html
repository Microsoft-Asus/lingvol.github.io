Make sure you definitely go on a diet. Use nowloss.com/diet or use nowloss.com/5 if you hate counting calories. How much you eat and not necessarily a diet is the most important thing to help you lose these 30 pounds as fast as you possibly can. Without a diet or by eating too much you are simply wasting your time when trying to lose body fat doing my HIIT weight loss workouts<br /><br />2. Do any of my fat loss work outs meaning you can do the ‘FUCK Being FAT. DO THIS &amp; Lose 30 Pounds in 30 Days’ workout or any of my other weight loss workouts at nowloss.com/fatloss which can all be accessed thru this YouTube playlist @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF52868D2E6449DE0">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF52868D2E6449DE0</a> for free or yes, you can also get them via dvd by singing up for the dvd at nowloss.com/dvd<br /><br />3. Drink at least 2 liters of water a day. See nowloss.com/fast for why drinking more water in your diet could possibly help you lose 5 pounds in 1 day depending on what your current sodium or slat and water intake is right now.<br /><br />No excuses. I designed to workout to have options for each exercise so you will not have any reason for you not to reach your ultimate reach weight loss goal.<br /><br />Can’t do ski steps? Do them seated. Ski steps too easy? Then sprint back and forth, add punches to firm up your abs or add twist to firm up your love handles or to burn off your love handles as you burn off any other fat on your body<br /><br />Can’t do burpees then you have many options. Use a chair to do half burpees or to do burpees without kicking your legs back to make the burpee exercise more accessible to you and your weight loss goals. Too easy? Then add push-ups to your burpee to actually do a true burpee. Yes, I admit I’m not really doing an actual burpee in the video because what I’m doing is what is called an old-school squat thrust exercise but whatever it is it sure does kick your but to drop pounds fast.<br /><br />Jumping jacks too easy? Then do the jumping jack shuffle where you basically do a defensive slide from side to side as you do jumping jacks. Can’t do jumping jacks because of an injury? Then do jumping jacks seated or make snow angels on a floor or in the snow if you want to be able to still do jumping jacks as seen in this HIIT workout<br /><br />Squat and kicks have to be done with you bending your knees a lot more than your back so if you are unable to squat all the way down to the floor until the palm of your hands  touch the floor then you can either put your legs out wider to prevent you from having to squat down so far or you cannot squat down as low by placing some sort of platform under your body like I do in the video where I have a chair up under me to cue me in on when to stop myself from squatting down so low. If squat and kicks are too easy (which they may not be until after doing them for a while) then you can do a jump kick at the end to really boost your weight loss.<br /><br />If injured then see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nowloss.com/lose-weight-while-injured.htm">http://www.nowloss.com/lose-weight-while-injured.htm</a> for other fast weight loss workouts and tips you can use to still be able to possible lose 30 pounds fast<br /><br />For more in depth instructions on how to do all of my fast weight loss HIIT workouts then go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nowloss.com/fast-weight-loss-workout-routine-to-burn-fat-get-flat-belly-6-pack-abs.htm">http://www.nowloss.com/fast-weight-loss-workout-routine-to-burn-fat-get-flat-belly-6-pack-abs.htm</a> and also more weight loss workout tips to lose pounds very fast<br /><br />I think I’ve covered everything you need to do to lose 30 pounds in 30 days in this description or how to lose 30 pounds in exactly 1 months’ time if that month has 30 days in it but if you have any questions or need any more help on how to lose thirty pounds then please email me asap.<br /><br />Overall this video is my way of apologizing for the 'How To Lose 30 pounds in 30 seconds ' video I posted here 4 years ago at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0_I7j30Thc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0_I7j30Thc</a>
