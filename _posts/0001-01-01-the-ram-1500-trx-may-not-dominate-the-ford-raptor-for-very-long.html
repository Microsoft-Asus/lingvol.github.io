The Fastest Truck In The World - Ram TRX vs Ford Raptor<br />Recommended Books &amp; Car Products - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BrekJm">http://amzn.to/2BrekJm</a><br /><br />Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/VZstk7">https://goo.gl/VZstk7</a><br /><br /><br /><br />702 horsepower, 0-60 in 4.5 seconds, quarter mile in 12.9 seconds, and a top speed of 118 miles per hour. According to RAM it’s the quickest, fastest, and most powerful mass-produced truck in the world, so in this video we’re going to check out the clever engineering that has gone into it, how it may dominate the Ford Raptor (perhaps not for very long), and throw in a few bad jokes to keep our spirits high. <br /><br />If you’re wondering if Dodge, Ram, and the likes of Chrysler have run out of ideas, well, the answer is no, because they still haven’t fit the hellcat engine into their entire lineup. To recap, we have a hellcat challenger, charger, grand cherokee, and durango. I know we’re all patiently awaiting news of the Pacifica, but in the meantime the good news is the mission of hellcatting all the things draws closer to success with the launch of the Ram TRX. <br /><br />Under the hood is yes, the beautiful 6.2L Supercharged V8 you’ve come to love from the Hellcat lineup. It produces 702 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque in the TRX. And the engine is ready to be pushed, with a cast-iron block, forged-steel crankshaft, powder-forged connecting rods, and forged-alloy pistons. Some changes versus the other hellcats include a deep sump oil pan to keep the pickup tube in the oil under high g cornering, and the alternator has been moved higher to allow for 32 inches of water fording.  <br /><br />The air entering the engine comes from two locations. Half of it is fed through the functional hood scoop, and the other half from a ram air intake at the front of the grill. If you have a big truck with a big engine making big power out in a desert environment, well, you’re going to need some serious filtering. That’s why the RAM Trex has not just one, but two air filters, each measuring about 8x12 inches. The airbox is mounted up top, helping allow for that high water fording depth, in addition to providing easy access for the owner to clean out the filter elements. Ram states based on industry-standard tests, the Trex can ingest dirty air and debris longer than any competitor before performance begins to diminish. <br /><br />Here’s a bonkers fact about how much heat this engine has to reject from the intake charge. At wide open throttle, the intercooler is rejecting 40 kilowatts of heat, all of this heat just from the intake air alone. <br /><br />As far as the four wheel drive system, there’s an active transfer case which has a low range with 2.64:1 gearing, and the transfer case will vary the torque split depending on which mode you’re in: auto, sport, snow, tow, mud, and baja. Torque is sent to the front and rear differentials, and in the rear is an electronic locking diff, paired with a Dana 60 solid rear axle with full-floating shafts. From the differentials, we move out to the wheels, which you can option beadlock wheels from the factory. <br /><br />The Trex has over 13 inches of wheel travel in both the front and rear. Up front is an independent, active suspension with forged aluminum upper and lower control arms designed to maintain the appropriate camber angles during their long travel. There are massive, 2.5 wide Bilstein adaptive dampers in both the front and the rear which use a single-piece aluminum construction with machined cooling fins for heat dissipation. In the rear is a 5-link coil suspension that allows the solid axle to travel up to 13 inches!<br /><br />Pairing the T-Rex side by side with the Ford Raptor, it’s pretty obvious what Ram was benchmarking. Many of the stats line up near perfectly, with the Trex having slight advantages. The most notable difference, really, is the power. 252 more horsepower, and 140 more lb-ft of torque versus the Raptor. <br /><br />Engineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't forget to check out my other pages below!<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained">http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained</a><br /><br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.howdoesacarwork.com">http://www.howdoesacarwork.com</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13">http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained">http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained</a><br /><br />Car Throttle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained">https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained</a><br /><br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained">https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained</a><br /><br />EE Extra: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA</a><br /><br /><br /><br />NEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!
