Festival of Lessons and Carols is a customary worship at Converse College that celebrates the Christmas season. This year, in lieu of hosting the event in person, Converse recorded a modified version which includes music and select verses of the Christmas story. Luminary submissions that were received by Friday, November 13th will be recognized at the end of the video.
