Congratulations inventRight student Keanu A. on licensing three products in just 12 weeks! Keanu clued into a hot category for reinvention — pocket knives! He shares his invention journey with inventRight cofounder Andrew Krauss, including the fact that some of his licensed products are more design oriented than functionality-oriented. We are seriously inspired, Keanu! Thank you for sharing your story of invention with us!<br /><br />Here's how Keanu described his inventRight one-on-one coaching experience: <br /><br />&quot;I’m 24 years old, born and raised in San Diego, California.<br /><br />I have been working full-time as a business analyst for the past 2 years and just recently received my MBA in 2019.<br /><br />At the beginning of 2020, the world was devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Like millions of other people, I too was feeling quite sad and unsure of what the future had to offer.<br /><br />One day I was cleaning my room and stumbled upon a piece of paper that had a sketch of a product I had drawn back in 2018. With nothing to lose, I decided to take a leap of faith.<br /><br />I taught myself CAD and was able to create a digital prototype of my product. I filed a PPA using the SmartIP system and with the knowledge I obtained from the inventRight YouTube videos, I submitted my product to 48 companies. I received many harsh rejections, but in 6 days I also received a licensing contract.<br /><br />I have since become an inventRight student; I only wish I had joined sooner. I have started a few other projects and hope to secure contracts for those as well. I am so happy and grateful that I have joined the inventor community and excited to see where this journey takes me.<br /><br />If you are thinking about joining – don’t hesitate!
