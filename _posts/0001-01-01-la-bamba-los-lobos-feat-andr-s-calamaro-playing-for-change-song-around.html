As we traveled, musicians everywhere mixed the traditional and rock 'n' roll styles of &quot;La Bamba&quot; into a new Song Around The World.<br /><br />JOIN THE MOVEMENT<br />Subscribe to our newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1x9CAfJ">http://bit.ly/1x9CAfJ</a><br />Join us as a YouTube Member here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn25nZ12HEZq_w_m_1DmbbA/sponsor">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn25nZ12HEZq_w_m_1DmbbA/sponsor</a><br /><br />GET SOCIAL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PlayingForChange">https://www.facebook.com/PlayingForChange</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/playing4change">https://twitter.com/playing4change</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/playing4change">http://instagram.com/playing4change</a><br /><br />Playing For Change (PFC) is a movement created to inspire and connect the world through music, born from the shared belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. The primary focus of PFC is to record and film musicians performing in their natural environments and combine their talents and cultural power in innovative videos called Songs Around The World. Creating these videos motivated PFC to form the Playing For Change Band—a tangible, traveling representation of its mission, featuring musicians met along their journey; and establish the Playing For Change Foundation—a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world. Through these efforts, Playing For Change aims to create hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.<br /><br />To learn more about the work of the PFC Foundation, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.playingforchange.org">http://www.playingforchange.org</a>
