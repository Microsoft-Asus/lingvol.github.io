Tonight, I did a technique called Color Blocking with a Twist! It's a fun technique and it allows you to make up to 10 cards at a time. You can do full blown rainbows or monochromatic blends and it's a lot like putting together a fun puzzle.<br /><br />Stamps used:<br />Holiday Tapestry<br />Sunshine Mini Set<br /><br />Dies used:<br />Hello<br />Master Layouts 3<br /><br />You can find our products here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/32g211p">https://bit.ly/32g211p</a><br /><br />Thank you so much for joining me!<br />Hugs,<br />Gina K.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Affiliate links used at no additional cost to you.
