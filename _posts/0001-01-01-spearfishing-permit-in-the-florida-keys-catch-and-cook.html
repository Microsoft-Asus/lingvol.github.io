We drive down from Key largo and past Islamorada to Long Key to do some spearfishing. We are spearfishing layton key to be specific which is one of the florida keys islands.<br /><br />PS: You have to be 3 miles from land to be allowed to spearfish in the Florida keys. Spearfishing is not allowed in the bay or close to land.<br /><br />This catch and cook episode is full of fish! We catch permit, catch lobster catch stone crab while spearfishing and we catch and cook them all!<br /><br />Obviously the most exiting part of this South Florida Fishing Episode is the Permit catch and cook because I have never done a catch and cook with permit here on the South Florida Fishing Channel!<br /><br />Permit season and lobster season is almost over so we are eager to catch permit and catch lobster.<br /><br />So we head 3 miles from land and start spearfishing. We run into some snapper and barracuda but still not exactly what we are looking for...<br /><br />We swim with dolphin and enjoy the florida keys lifestyle for a moment and then it happens. The Florida Permit show up on the reef! BAM I shoot a permit and Chris also shoots a permit spearfishing.<br /><br />Looks like this will be a permit catch and cook after all!<br /><br />Wait..<br /><br />This will be more than just a catch and cook I want to show you how Craig cleans and fillets a permit. So let's call this a permit catch clean cook as Rob from Deer Meat for Dinner likes to say! It's Catch Clean Cook time!<br /><br />We will cook permit 3 ways at lazy lobster but wait... let's go back a moment.<br /><br />After we spearfish a permit we run back into the bay and stop at some mangroves to look for lobster and stone crabs. Sure enough I catch lobster and I even catch a stone crab!<br /><br />Looks like a lobster catch and cook is also on the menu. And not only lobster but also a stone crab catch and cook!<br /><br />This is a Catch Clean Cook episode bonus!<br /><br />This has been such an amazing spearfishing trip in the Florida Keys. I love spearfishing Florida and all the things you see. Like the dolphin we saw!<br /><br />If you enjoyed this Spearfishing permit in the Florida keys catch and cook episode on the South Florida Fishing Channel then SMASH that like button and if you are new to my fishing channel please consider hitting that subscribe button.<br /><br />You're favorite Catch and Cook channel on Youtube
