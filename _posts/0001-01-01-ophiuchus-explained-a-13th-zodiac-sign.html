Read our whole article here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://myastrosecrets.com/ophiuchus/">https://myastrosecrets.com/ophiuchus/</a><br /><br />Ophiuchus Zodiac Sign:<br /><br />In this video we explain everything you need to know about Ophiuchus. Some people refer to it as being the 13th zodiac sign whilst others don't agree with this statement. Let's tell you all about it.<br /><br />Within astrology there are different approaches to live by. The most common one is also known as Tropical astrology. You have probably heard of the 12 Zodiac signs. That's what they are all about.<br /><br />Some people prefer to practice Sidereal astrology. In that case there is room for other signs because there is no rule of 12. Make sure to watch the video to comprehend this better.<br /><br />Ophiuchus is in fact present in our Zodiac system. However for the most part it's not. Only a small portion of it extends into that area. Therefore there is a discussion about whether or not we should add it to our list.<br /><br />A 13th Zodiac sign means that for some people there would be a big change in their astrological beliefs. It would also mean that we would get a 13th horoscope. Are there more of these signs that would want a place as well? With how many would we end up?<br /><br />The star sign Ophiuchus matters very much to a big group of people. And they have the right to do so. In the end it's partially present in the space that we base our signs on.<br /><br />Whether or not we pay attention to it, it's certainly not a fairy tale. We can view it through our telescopes and maybe we should in fact appreciate it more. Going by 12 or 13 signs is both understandable and that's what we try to make you understand.<br /><br />In case you are curious, the Ophiuchus date lasts from November 29th until December 18th. Let us know how you feel about all this.
