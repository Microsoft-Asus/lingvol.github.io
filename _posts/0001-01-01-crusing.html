{% raw %}&quot;Cruising life through minimal equations&quot; - Sergea Patricea<br /><br />It is a site specific performance in the frame of &quot;Reclaim&quot; curated by Amanda Piña and María Veza. The gathering and action is a call for us to pay attention to the oldest names of &quot;earth&quot; such a Gaia, Dhara and Gea for example. The specific location revolves around about our displacement of our mother or matriarchal energies that are connected to mother - earth. In the context of the current world wide crisis, art as experience is one of the only places where we can think collectively with freedom. Using spaces and embodiment of ancient knowledge through the abstraction of simple figures, names, voices of an old wild generation of humankind that reclaim us back to their understanding , we can cruise today with our voice to claim justice, earth protection and the rescue of our inner useless equations to solve the hopeless context of today’s events.<br /><br />&quot;RECLAIM&quot; - curated by Amanda Piña and Veza Maria Fernandez<br />Ph: Federico Moccia, Vienna.
