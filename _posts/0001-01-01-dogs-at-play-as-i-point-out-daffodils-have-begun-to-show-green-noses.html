This will definitely be the last pass for ewes to graze this field. I shall bring them out tonight.<br /><br /><br />Zwartbles Ireland is a small company run from a farm in County Kilkenny in Ireland. We sell, Zwartbles sheep, Zwartbles blankets and yarn made from the sheep, and calendars featuring the Cats Shepherd Bodacious and Inca the World's Smallest Sheepdog.
