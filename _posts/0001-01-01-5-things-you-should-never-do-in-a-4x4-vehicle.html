Today I go over some basics on what you should not do in a 4x4 vehicle! <br /><br />First up on the list is to never floor it to try and get unstuck.  This will actually get your truck even more stuck, because there is less friction between the tire and the ground making you continue to spin.  Getting unstuck should be controlled and worked slowly to gain every bit of traction possible.  It's when the truck is going zero that you don't want to spin, because you won't move at all.  It would be helpful to have some recovery boards or a tow strap or even a winch in this case.<br /><br />Next up is switching into 4 low.  This should only be done when the vehicle is stopped and the truck is in neutral.  Most vehicles now have a lock out to where it won't work unless you are stopped and in neutral.  When you use 4 low, the front axle will be &quot;locked&quot; with the rear axle to spin at the same rate so in order for them to sync and be locked properly, the rear axle needs to not be moving in order to do so. By not following this procedure, you can risk putting added wear and tear on mechanical components which would cost a lot more than taking the time to do it correctly. <br /><br />When to use traction control VS not to use it is next.  Traction control is your friend when you are out on the roads, driving in the snow, ice or rain and is designed to keep you safe and detect when a tire starts to spin to allow the truck to stay stable and on the road.  Traction control is not your friend offroad, in this case, you should know what you are doing off the pavement and use the full capabilities of the truck by turning it off.  This will allow the tires to spin if needed and allow you to have full control of the throttle to get through whatever terrain it may be!  <br /><br />Cleaning your vehicle is very important after a great day on the trails!  This will keep your truck in proper working conditions for the time you are driving out on the roads and keep everything mechanical working properly as well.  Inspect the underside of the vehicle for rocks or branches that could be trapped within the frame or brakes and make sure you are ready for the drive home.  This will keep your truck in great shape for the long run and you can still have fun on the trails!  The best of both worlds! <br /><br />Last up is to not lock differentials on the pavement.  This is a recipe for disaster for sure because this means that both the wheels on the same axle are now locked to spin at the same rate.  That's great for the trails because the wheels have less friction and can still spin fine in loose rocks or sand, but on dry pavement, friction is greatly increase and you will experience wheel skid or spin especially turning and case greatly increase stress on the mechanical components of the truck.<br /><br />Vlog/Action Camera:<br />- Sony Alpha a5100: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Pt5pCS">https://amzn.to/2Pt5pCS</a><br />- GoPro Hero 8: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Qvg5Q2">https://amzn.to/2Qvg5Q2</a><br />- GoPro Hero 7: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NHSyKz">https://amzn.to/2NHSyKz</a><br />- GoPro Hero: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Uk8IuF">https://amzn.to/2Uk8IuF</a><br /><br />Music By:<br />www.epidemicsound.com<br /><br />#toyotatacoma #offroading #4x4vehicle #toyota #tacomatrd #trdoffroad #offroadingatacoma
