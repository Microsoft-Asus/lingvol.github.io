Started 20th of July at 92kg/202lbs.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's no footage from august since the video wasn't planned until I really noticed results towards the start of September.<br /><br />&quot;TODAY, 18TH OF OCTOBER, IS MY BIRTHDAY! But, that's not why this is a big day for me. 18th of October happens to be the end-date for the goal I set up 3 months ago.<br /><br />By coincidence, sometime in early July I stood on a scale. The scale showed 94kg's... 6kg's from 100. I was 20 years old. 175cm's and almost a 100kg's. I've never really been the kind of person that cares about what people think of my looks. Unfortunately, health hasn't either been an enough reason for me to stop eating large amounts of junk food, sugar, soda and other foods of low nutritional value. Regardless of what might have resulted in my weight gain, I knew that it couldn't continue.<br /><br />20th of July 2015 (92kg), I decided that I'd lose my body fat and increase (or at least maintain my muscle mass), until the point where I would be able to see my abs. Since I'd never in my entire life been fit enough to were I could see my own abs. With 18th of October as my end-date and 75kg as my goal, I knew there'd be lots of difficult challenges waiting for me down the road.<br /><br />My determination combined with Hasse's knowledge and experience (one of my closest friends), resulted in me completely crushing my goal. Down the road lot's of people have criticized me, told me that it's not possible in such a short period of time, that I'm starving myself, that I'm training too hard, too long, too much... But just like there's negativity around you, so is positivity. And, at the end of the day all that matters is what you let inside of your mind. &quot;You can't stop someone who knows where they are going&quot;.<br /><br />However, &quot;good is not enough, if better is possible&quot;. With new goals ahead of me, the journey continues. For those who want to follow me on my journey; follow me on Instagram: rezbkr.
