Life as a General Practitioner can be exhilarating, from not knowing what is coming through the door to being a detective when listening and examining patients. In this episode, I take you behind the scenes with me to see what a typical day is like. <br /><br />In the morning, I kick start my day with a cup of coffee and prepare my equipment on my desk, which comprises of my stethoscope, pen and a bottle of water. I then spend some time checking through my results inbox and see which results should be dealt with urgently or routinely. After this, I take a look at my appointment book so that I have an understanding of what to expect during the day and how to pace myself. Then it's time to see my lovely patients. <br /><br />During this particular day, I had a mixed bag of presentations, from routine medical consults, to cosmetic injectables to family planning procedures. In the middle of the day I usually have a long lunch break, however on this day I chose to spend a little more time with my cosmetic injectable patient and you'll find the treatment video online very soon. The variety of my day makes it very exciting and I thoroughly enjoy the different cases I see. Throughout the day I always ensure that I'm staying hydrated and have time to reflect and write up my notes as I see my patients. <br /><br />COMPANION VIDEOS<br />Part 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jqnM6fkG-f8">https://youtu.be/jqnM6fkG-f8</a><br />Rural GP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g3zpI-D1k94">https://youtu.be/g3zpI-D1k94</a><br />Urban GP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HH_9i0M2xAI">https://youtu.be/HH_9i0M2xAI</a><br />Christmas Special: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bjbi91Gd5AQ">https://youtu.be/bjbi91Gd5AQ</a><br />Natural Lip Filler: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RsxDQS3FYLY">https://youtu.be/RsxDQS3FYLY</a><br /><br />STETHOSCOPE<br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vtudio.com/a/?a=littmann+classic">https://vtudio.com/a/?a=littmann+classic</a><br />eBay: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vtudio.com/a/?e=littmann+classic">https://vtudio.com/a/?e=littmann+classic</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching, if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below.<br /><br />Take care and stay healthy, <br />Dr Nora ðŸ’‰<br /><br />FILM BY VTUDIO | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vtudio.com">https://vtudio.com</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br />Wowamusic - blueskypt2<br /><br />FILMING TOOLS<br />iPhone 11 Pro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vtudio.com/a/?a=iphone+11+pro">https://vtudio.com/a/?a=iphone+11+pro</a><br />Sony A7III: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vtudio.com/a/?e=sony+a7iii">https://vtudio.com/a/?e=sony+a7iii</a><br />More: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vtudio.com/tools">https://vtudio.com/tools</a><br /><br />Links to products often include an affiliate tracking code which allow us to earn fees on purchases you make through them.
