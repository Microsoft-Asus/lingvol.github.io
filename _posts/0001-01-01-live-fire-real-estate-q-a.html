Given the availability in my calendar is limited I have to charge $99/hour to ensure I don’t get swamped with requests that I cannot respond to for months. That said, most of what you need to know is out there on Youtube and in my videos. I look forward to hearing you.<br /><br />Mike has a true rags to riches success story that proves anyone can do what they set their minds to. He grew up in poverty bouncing from home to home and realized at age 17, when he moved away for college, that there was this early retirement movement - nicknamed the &quot;FIRE Movement.&quot; It was there, in his college dorm-room that he set out to be the youngest retiree, and retire in only 7 short years (17 to 24 years of age). He achieved the goal of becoming a self-made millionaire, with a young family, at the age of 24 through hard work, extreme frugality, and astute Real-estate investing.<br />Today, Mike (26) works hard to share what worked for him, what didn’t, and to help educate others on all things Real-Estate and personal finance. He is now on a mission to help educate &amp; assist others on all things Real Estate as they unlock financial independence for themselves! He recently co-founded a full service real estate investment management firm (RightWay Management Inc.) in London, Ontario that specializes in helping investors unlock much higher than normal market returns so that they can unlock early retirement through rental income cash-flow (averaging $1000+/month per property he partners with investors on). He is currently scaling up very quickly, acquiring over one property per week in London with investor partners. Mike has been involved in purchasing 50+ deals with investors &amp; friends in the last 2 years.
