{% raw %}Very Same Power <br /><br />Jesus, Jesus my redeemer<br />There’s no greater love than what You’ve given me<br />Hallelujah! I’m forgiven<br />Aand I’ll never be chained again<br /><br />Because the very same power that raised Christ from the dead<br />Iis alive in me<br />And the very same power that overcame the grave<br />Iit lives in me<br />And now I am complete since He rescued me, since He rescued me<br />I’m gonna shout it out loud<br /><br />Jesus, Jesus my redeemer<br />There’s no greater love than what You’ve given me<br />Hallelujah! I’m forgiven<br />Aand I’ll never be chained again<br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />No more chains holding me from now on I am free.<br />I’m gonna shout it out loud{% endraw %}
