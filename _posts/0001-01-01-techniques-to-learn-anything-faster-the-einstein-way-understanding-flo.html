Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could learn anything faster using the same learning techniques Great Physicist Albert Einstein?<br />There are 3 such techniques discussed in this video, so stick till the end!<br />Einstein once wrote in a letter to his son that &quot;The way to learn the most, is that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don’t notice that the time passes. I am sometimes so wrapped up in my work that I forget about the noon meal”<br /><br />Haven’t we all experienced it? Reading a book and forgetting about everything else, or singing along to a favourite song without realising where we are, or just getting super involved in a game on our mobile phones! This is what Psychologists call Flow.<br /><br />Background Soundtrack: <br />That Kid in Fourth Grade Who Really Liked the Denver Broncos by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/uvp/">http://chriszabriskie.com/uvp/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/">http://chriszabriskie.com/</a><br /><br />Video Url<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlkj9yLXo98&amp;t=9s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlkj9yLXo98&amp;t=9s</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://neurovoider.tumblr.com/">http://neurovoider.tumblr.com/</a>
