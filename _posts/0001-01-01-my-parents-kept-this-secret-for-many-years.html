I'm 14 years old. Tell me, do your parents love each other? Well, of course they do, that's how it’s supposed to be in a normal family. They are kind and care for each other. But what if none of it is real? What if they're just pretending? “How is that possible?” you might ask. Subscribe to the channel and watch my story. I’m going to tell you a secret I’ve learned about my parents.
