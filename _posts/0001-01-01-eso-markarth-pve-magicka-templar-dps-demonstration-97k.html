Same build as in the main video, switched out maw of the infernal for zaan due to the stealth nerf to maw. <br />please refer to the original video for build information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGcFnBQIYC4&amp;t=8s&amp;ab_channel=Nymzy">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGcFnBQIYC4&amp;t=8s&amp;ab_channel=Nymzy</a><br />Info graphic for the rotation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imgur.com/a/InNl7PA">https://imgur.com/a/InNl7PA</a><br /><br />The dummy has some additional buffs now like major vunerability which increases dps flatout by 10% compared to parses on previous patches. Dps in content should be noticeably lower. I would say the dps roughly transelates to 88-89k in the Stonethorn patch.<br /><br />I have been parsing for about 20 minutes and it feels kinda clunky compared to previous patches, sweeps animations are skipped and the character bugs out after casting purifying light. I worked around this by bashweaving once in a while to reset my characters animation.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what the future has in store for the templar but right now it's not in a very competitive spot. Dps is one of the lowest being comparable to magdk. Difference however is that group compositions will always have a place for magdk's because of engulfing flames unlike the templar which very often has no group benefit due to there already being a templar healer.
