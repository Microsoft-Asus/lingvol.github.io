{% raw %}From secret underground bunkers to horrifying archaeological discoveries – plus new findings from Mars! Here are 10 incredible recent discoveries that just happened!<br /><br />Subscribe to Talltanic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/wgfvrr">http://goo.gl/wgfvrr</a><br /><br />Watch Our MOST Popular Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPhVZExcGXg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPhVZExcGXg</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBfU-z1G0fw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBfU-z1G0fw</a><br /><br />10: German Bunker<br />There are always new discoveries made in the world of Nazi Germany. One of the most recent discoveries was made by researchers in Normandy who discovered a huge complex of Nazi bunkers that had not been seen by anyone in around 75 years. <br /><br />9: Mission to Venus<br />This next one is both news and a discovery. After some recent scientific findings revealed the possibility of life on the planet Venus, NASA is now considering a mission to go there. They are apparently considering at least two planetary science missions to Venus by next April. <br /><br />8: Lakes on Mars<br />Let's stick with the stars for just another minute and check out the newest discoveries from Mars. Speaking of life on other planets, planetary scientists have just discovered a total of four lakes hidden under the surface of the Red Planet.<br /><br />7: Humans Still Evolving<br />We typically believe that evolution takes millions and millions of years to produce results. But this simply is not true. Evolution is an ongoing process, and recent research has proved that human beings are still evolving as we speak. To understand this entirely, we should start from the beginning.<br /><br />6: Archaeology Horror<br />Here we have a horrifying discovery out of Britain. It all started back in the 60s when a human skull was discovered near Basingstoke during excavations prior to the development of a housing unit. <br /><br />5: Dog Brains<br />Moving away from terrifying archaeological discoveries, let's take a look at two recent discoveries that have totally turned the tables on how scientists understand dogs and their brains! <br /><br />4: Ancient Workshop<br />In 2020, archaeologists may have uncovered evidence of the very first furnace ever to be used on earth. This happened when an archaeological excavation uncovered what appeared to be a workshop once used for smelting copper ore. <br /><br />3: Mysterious Carvings<br />For centuries, villagers living in the dusty hills of China’s Loess Plateau believed that the rock walls near their homes were actually part of the Great Wall of China. It does make sense, considering that the dry region has been at the frontier of Chinese rule for over 2000 years. <br /><br />2: Canada–Australia Connection<br />It's true that Canada and Australia were both British colonies at one point, but new fossil discoveries show an even older connection between these two countries. The discovery of a tiny insect fossil in Canada, estimated to be around 50 million years old, has raised some serious questions about what the earth looked like all those years ago. <br /><br />1: New Fish in the Coral Sea<br />Last on the list are some new fish discoveries that happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. Scientists working remotely with the Schmidt Ocean Institute to study one of the world's largest continental margin plateaus underwater have discovered at least 10 new species of fish, snails, and sponges. <br /><br />#mysteriousdiscoveries #recentdiscoveries #incrediblediscoveries #talltanic{% endraw %}
