I've been pretty effusive on the site about my love of Starry Eyes, which is easily one of the best (possibly the best) horror films of 2014, so I jumped at the chance to share this exclusive scene with you.  It comes from the film's Blu-ray, which is chock full of additional scenes, an intense audition tape and a lively and informative commentary from directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer and producer Travis Stevens.  The scene is titled &quot;Waiting for the Call&quot; and anyone who has ever stressed over getting a callback, for a dream job or from someone you like, will be able to relate.  It really captures the anxiety of what it feels like to be on there verge of something going right for a change.  Is it the best scene from the movie?  No.  The best scenes are in the movie.  But it is an excellent primer for the desperation that Alex Essoe's character, Sarah, feels throughout the majority of the film.<br /><br />Starry Eyes was included in Perri's Top 10 list this year and you should check out my interview with Kölsch and Widmyer while you're at it.  Check out the deleted scene below. The Starry Eyes Blu-ray will be available tomorrow, February 3rd.  Once you open it you can flip the insert around so the original Jay Shaw artwork greets you every time you pull it off your shelf.<br /><br />For More Collider:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://collider.com/">http://collider.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/collidernews">https://twitter.com/collidernews</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom">https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom</a><br /><br />As the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination; it’s the homepage for young men obsessed with staying ahead of the curve.<br /><br />Exclusive 'Starry Eyes' Deleted Scene Will Definitely Make You Anxious from Collider.
