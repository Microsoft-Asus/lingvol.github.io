Oh god, I've been sucked to this meme now. Actually, two memes.<br />I forgotten to mention it's also my last video of this year and has my retarded voice. But anyways, I can't believe no one came up with this idea yet and this gave me a little treat to work on. This took me like 3 hours to make sense the source wasn't that hard cause I skipped the whole song to the net scene cause I didn't feel like doing the whole song. Anyways, the reason I skipped the whole song except the net scene was because it was the only good scene to add the nebby meme on. Anyways, enjoy this content and I apologize for my retarded voice and that this video looked rushed.<br />Robbie needs your donation here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/2tm9tqk">https://www.gofundme.com/2tm9tqk</a><br />Disclaimer: I DO NOT OWN ANYTHING, THIS WAS MADE FOR FAIR USE!
