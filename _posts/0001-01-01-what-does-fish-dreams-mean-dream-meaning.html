Fish is a symbol of destiny, foreshadowing the impending affairs, acquisitions, or a nuisance, depending on where you see the fish. If you dream of fish, this generally suggests the emotional side of your character. Each fish has its own individual meaning. If you dream of a salmon or pink fish, this generally symbolizes that you are going to have some important experiences in the near future. If you see a white fish, things are looking positive in regards to your love life.
