Extensive reading has be shown by researchers to be one of the most effective methods for learning a new language (and possibly the single most effective method).<br />In this video, I explain the benefits, and how to include extensive reading in your language learning routine. <br /><br />••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br />New to my channel?<br /><br />Welcome! I am an aspiring polyglot with a degree in Linguistics.  I speak English, Spanish, French, and Esperanto, and I'm currently working on Thai. I make videos twice a week to talk about my methods of learning languages and to try to help others make language learning faster, easier, and more fun. <br /><br />•Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fingtamLangs">https://twitter.com/fingtamLangs</a><br /><br />•Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fingtam.languages/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/fingtam.languages/?hl=en</a><br /><br />•My Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FingtamLanguages">https://www.youtube.com/c/FingtamLanguages</a><br /><br />•Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FingtamLanguages?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/FingtamLanguages?sub_confirmation=1</a>
