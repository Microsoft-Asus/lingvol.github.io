The dilemma facing Deputy President William Ruto over the BBI referendum has deepened with over 5.2 million signatures set to be submitted to the electoral commission in a week's time.<br /><br />The submission of the signatures, collected in a record five days, essentially means Ruto's set of demands has been rejected, further isolating him from the centre of power.<br /><br />Ruto, the country's second in command, has said he will not be leading a 'No' campaign to avert a direct confrontation with his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta who is supporting the BBI push.<br /><br />However, the DP's camp has made demands, including having the referendum and the 2022 General Election held on the same day as part of his conditions to back the plebiscite.<br /><br />On Friday, BBI secretariat co-chairmen Junet Mohamed and Dennis Waweru announced that the signatures will be submitted to the IEBC within a week.<br /><br />Junet, a key Raila ally and Waweru, a diehard supporter of the President publicly scolded Ruto for his conditions.<br /><br />&quot;In the next one week, we are going to ensure that the signatures have been submitted to IEBC, &quot;Waweru said<br /><br />Junet said Ruto is free to spearhead his own constitutional review process.<br /><br />Key parliamentary leaders also vowed to vanquish Ruto's bid for a multiple-choice referendum by enacting a law providing only a closed Yes or No plebiscite.<br /><br />Speaking while receiving the 5.2 million signatures in Nairobi, opposition chief Raila Odinga also declared that the BBI train had bolted from the station.<br /><br />Raila said those opposing the referendum should join the No side instead of making what he termed unrealistic demands.<br /><br />“Let the ballot decide, if you have the numbers, we shall accept defeat and you should also be ready to accept if we defeat you,” Raila declared when he received the 5.2 million signatures from regional coordinators.<br /><br />Raila who spoke at Daraja House, the BBI secretariat offices where he officially closed the signature collection exercise, said Kenyans are not ready for a multi-choice referendum which he said will be confusing.<br /><br />Raila said the signature collection was a major success and signals a very strong seal of approval.<br /><br />&quot;In a couple of days, we move to the IEBC to hand over these signatures for verification and necessary action. We expect the IEBC to equally move with speed as Kenyans have done and released the process to the next stage,&quot; Raila said.<br /><br />This could dash Ruto's hopes of any consensus-building around the referendum issues or processes to guarantee what he has termed a win-win situation that does not further divide the country.<br /><br />Raila said already, the current election with six ballots has been a problem, adding that the IEBC wants the polls staggered so that elections of governors and senators are separated from those of President, member of Parliament, and MCA.<br /><br />“There are those saying that let us have a multiple-choice referendum like the KCPE exams. Kenyans who are illiterate can't manage that, adding another seventh ballot, for an illiterate voter, that would be asking for too much,” the former prime minister said.<br /><br />In a swipe at Ruto who has been pushing for consensus in the referendum push, Raila said that was just a fallacy as a referendum in its nature entails competition.<br /><br />“As a veteran politician, I am not aware of a referendum that has no opposing sides. There is nothing like a contested referendum there must be two opposing views, there is no way there will be no opposition,” Raila maintained.
