There's a Fire!!! It's happening again. About a month ago we had some close calls with a wildfire near us. There were mandatory evacuations and school was cancelled for a few days. Today, school was cancelled due to another fire. Mom didn't know how bad the fire was so she took Trinity and Madison to school only to realize that she missed the notification that they were cancelling. We kept a close eye on the fire and looks like we've got nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Follow the Beyond Family:<br />FaceBook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/trinityandbeyond">https://facebook.com/trinityandbeyond</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/trinityandbeyond.yt/">https://instagram.com/trinityandbeyond.yt/</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiktok.com/@beyondfamily.yt">http://tiktok.com/@beyondfamily.yt</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TrinityBeyondYT">https://twitter.com/TrinityBeyondYT</a><br /><br />Watch More Beyond Family Vlogs:<br />Newest Uploads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k2clhwx15g&amp;list=PLL5ucNnbou07jsOZP7od1t9ucoTR__nhR">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k2clhwx15g&amp;list=PLL5ucNnbou07jsOZP7od1t9ucoTR__nhR</a><br />Popular Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSoq6i_Xybs&amp;list=PLL5ucNnbou05av2oL8L_ktSum6-469_si">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSoq6i_Xybs&amp;list=PLL5ucNnbou05av2oL8L_ktSum6-469_si</a><br /><br />About Beyond Family Vlogs:<br />Hey guys!
