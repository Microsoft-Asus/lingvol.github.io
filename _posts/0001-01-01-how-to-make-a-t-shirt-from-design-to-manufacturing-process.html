Checkout this free training we created to help you cut through the clutter and launch your brand easily: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Free-Apparel-Training">http://bit.ly/Free-Apparel-Training</a><br /><br />The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. <br /><br />0:00 Intro Into Making a T-shirt from Design to Manufacturing<br /><br />Step 1: 0:51 T-Shirt Design <br />The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.<br /><br />Step 2:  1:35 Pattern Making<br />Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. <br /><br />Step 3: 2:55 Sample Cutting<br />Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. <br /><br />Step 4: 4:45 Sewing The T-Shirt<br />After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. <br /><br />Step 5: 6:36 Mass Production Cutting<br />As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. <br /><br />Step 6: 8:30 Mass Production Sewing <br />Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. <br /><br />Step 7: 8:55 Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution<br />The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees.
