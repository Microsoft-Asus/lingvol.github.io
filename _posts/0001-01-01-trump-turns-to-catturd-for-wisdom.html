But a number of pro-Trump Republicans have taken to Parler, the &quot;free-speech&quot; social media platform, to discourage members of their own party from voting.<br /><br />Screenshots shared by reporter Marcus Baram showed Trump supporters invoking a conspiracy theory about &quot;rigged&quot; voting machines to urge a boycott of the upcoming elections in Georgia. &quot;Don't vote! Don't be part of the corruption&quot; one post read.&quot;<br /><br />#TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks
