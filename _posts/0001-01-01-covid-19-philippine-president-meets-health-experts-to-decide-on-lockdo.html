Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has met health experts to decide whether to extend the lockdown on the main island of Luzon. 19 more deaths were reported on April 20, along with 200 new infections. The number of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines has exceeded 6,400, and 428 people have died. The entire island of Luzon -- which includes the capital Metro Manila -- has been under partial lockdown since mid-March. Mr Duterte is facing pressure to allow some businesses to reopen to prevent an economic disaster. <br /><br />Subscribe to our channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/youtubesub">https://cna.asia/youtubesub</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to our news service on Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/telegram">https://cna.asia/telegram</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow us:<br /><br />CNA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia">https://cna.asia</a><br /><br />CNA Lifestyle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cnalifestyle.com">http://www.cnalifestyle.com</a> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia</a>
