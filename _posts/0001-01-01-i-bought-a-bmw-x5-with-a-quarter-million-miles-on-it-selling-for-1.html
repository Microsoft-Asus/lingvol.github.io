{% raw %}Click here harrys.com/watchjrgo to get you $5 off any Harry’s Holiday gift set! Quick before they’re gone!<br /><br />The BMW X5 is a car I've wanted since I was a little kid. That signature BMW powerplant, all wheel drive, and easy to work on is. a pretty compelling package. When I got the chance to pick one up for $1,500 I jumped at it. This one has been well taken care of and at 253,000 miles it doesn't smoke, minimal lifter tick, and only small deferred maintenance issues. I'm going to breath a bit more life into this car, then sell it for $1 for Christmas (I can't legally do a giveaway so it's a very good sale price).<br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shopWatchJRGo.com">http://shopWatchJRGo.com</a><br />Shop Motul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://motul.com">http://motul.com</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Common Questions:<br /><br />What motorcycle do I ride?
