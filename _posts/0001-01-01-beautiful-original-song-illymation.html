you're loved more than you know. LYRICS AND CREDITS BELOW:<br /><br />I fall apart on the floor in the kitchen<br />You're always there, I don't wanna make you listen<br />I'd rather do it on my own, try to fix it<br />Cuz maybe this time it'll be different<br /><br />Y'know, I've been burned before<br />You walk over to my door<br />Late at night when I knew better<br />The air was getting colder<br />You saw what I did to my shoulder<br />Late at night when I knew better<br /><br />But you say &quot;you're beautiful&quot;<br />And who'da known that I'd believe it?<br />Beautiful?<br />But that's the way it goes<br />That's the way it goes<br /><br />I'd like to say it'll go away with time<br />But it never really fades on this inside<br />What's the point when it's all in your mind?<br />It's a fight every day to stay alive<br /><br />And I've tried eight years<br />To conquer all my fears<br />But they got worse<br />Maybe I don't deserve <br />To feel happy in this world<br />Maybe I deserve to hurt<br /><br />But you say &quot;you're beautiful&quot;<br />And who'da known that I'd believe it?<br />Beautiful?<br />But that's the way it goes<br />That's the way it goes<br /><br />But if you saw me on the street you wouldn't know<br />Cuz I'm wearing long sleeves, say I'm cold<br />It feels bad feeling bad and I'm sorry<br />I'm a wreck and you're fine so what are we?<br /><br />The overpass is close<br />No one would even know<br />And no one would even care<br />I'll call my mom goodbye<br />I'm probably make her cry<br />But I won't be here to care<br /><br />But she says &quot;You're beautiful<br />So please don't go<br />You're loved more than you know<br />That's why you're beautiful.&quot;<br />And who'da known that's all I needed?<br />Beautiful?<br />You're beautiful<br />Do you know?<br />I hope you see it<br />Beautiful<br />And thats the way it goes<br />That's the way it goes<br /><br />Ooooo x4<br /><br />▶ SNEAK PEEKS ON PATREON! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/illymation">http://patreon.com/illymation</a><br /><br />▶ INSTRUMENTALS AND FINAL MIX: Ryder Burgin<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FootofaFerret">https://www.youtube.com/user/FootofaFerret</a><br /><br />▶ BG ARTIST, ASSISTANT ANIMATOR, AFTER EFFECTS MAGIC: Ingrid Umbach<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/iumba_">http://twitter.com/iumba_</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/iumba">http://instagram.com/iumba</a><br /><br />PROGRAMS USED:<br />▶ ToonBoom Harmony Premium - to animate<br />▶ Adobe Photoshop CC - background art / thumbnail<br />▶ Cintiq 16 Pro - screen tablet (but I recommend basic cheap pen tablets from Wacom)<br />▶ Adobe Premiere CC - to edit and compile<br /><br />STAY CONNECTED!<br />▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/illymation">https://instagram.com/illymation</a><br />▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illymation">https://twitter.com/illymation</a><br />▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/illymation">https://twitch.tv/illymation</a><br />▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://illymation.tumblr.com">https://illymation.tumblr.com</a><br />▶ MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creatorink.com/collections/illymation">https://creatorink.com/collections/illymation</a><br />▶ SECOND CHANNEL: SILLYMATION <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP9IBqJbr6RdNC-orxvzc9A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP9IBqJbr6RdNC-orxvzc9A</a><br /><br />- I'm sorry, I'm not available to do lines for videos anymore; I've gotten really busy :(<br /><br />- I am NOT looking for animation or video help!
