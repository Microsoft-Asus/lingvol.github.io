That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. <br /><br />Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House. <br /><br />» Subscribe to USA TODAY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh">http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh</a><br />» Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/30HuLzS">https://bit.ly/30HuLzS</a><br />» USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.<br /><br />#ElectionNight #ElectionResults #Election2020
