{% raw %}This animation is published in coordination with the new Nature article: A plausible metal-free ancestral analogue of the Krebs cycle composed entirely of α-ketoacids <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-00560-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-00560-7</a><br /><br />The origin of life is still a largely unsolved mystery. In recent years, many scientists have grown convinced that a deeper study of metabolism will reveal important secrets about the origin of life. In this animation you will learn why metabolism is so interesting to these researchers, and what the study of metabolism has revealed about the chemical origin of life so far.<br /><br />This animation is published in unison with the Nature paper: A plausible metal-free ancestral analogue of the Krebs cycle composed entirely of α-ketoacids<br /><br />For a full list of links to scientific papers and articles related to this animation, visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.statedclearly.com/videos/what-is-the-metabolism-first-hypothesis-for-the-origin-of-life/">https://www.statedclearly.com/videos/what-is-the-metabolism-first-hypothesis-for-the-origin-of-life/</a><br /><br />To support our work, visit us on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/statedclearly">https://www.patreon.com/statedclearly</a>{% endraw %}
