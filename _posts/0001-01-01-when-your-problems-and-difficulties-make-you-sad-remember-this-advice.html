Mahaperiyava's discourses has been written as magnum opus based on Hindu philosophy in a Tamil book titled - &quot;Deivathin Kural&quot;(Voice of God).<br /><br />Source credit: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50b.html">http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50b.html</a> <br /><br />Background music:<br />NIghtfall by Andy Leech<br />(Music provided by HearWeGo)<br /><br />About this channel - 'Supreme Yogi':<br />The word &quot;Supreme&quot; represent the 'highest Truth' (our inner Self or God or the Source of creation) that we all are seeking, and the word &quot;Yogi&quot; means one who attained union with that 'highest Truth' through years of spiritual sadhana. Since this channel is all about the teachings of such realized yogis, it is apt to use the name &quot;Supreme Yogi&quot;. <br /><br />Many of these great yogis lived in a time and place where there were no facilities available to record their teachings other than in written form. These valuable teachings are available only in book sources and hence this channel is a humble attempt to spread some of these hidden teachings to modern seekers who're searching for spiritual guidance and inspiration. <br /><br />If you've any enquiries or feedback, please contact: supremeyogivideos@gmail.com <br /><br />Thank you very much for all your love and support for this channel.
