&quot;As I Began to Love Myself&quot;, was written by Charlie Chaplin on his 70th birthday.<br /><br />Chaplin was a wise old-soul with a keen sense of wisdom beyond his era. His timeless words carry the power to affect the heart and inspire the mind. The subject of the poem is something each of us can relate to, and appreciate. Loving oneself is not an act of ego, but is an act of self-care â€“ and these words should serve as a reminder that you too, deserve to be loved.<br /><br />See full transcription here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2iNDOKx">http://bit.ly/2iNDOKx</a><br /><br />***Disclaimer: No copyright is claimed in the material used for this video and to the extent that material may appear to be infringed, I assert that such alleged infringement is permissible under fair use principles in U.S. copyright laws.
