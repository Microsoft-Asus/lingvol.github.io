Advertising tries to convince you to buy things, but nudging is about influencing customers without their knowing. It's only going to be used more and more, but where should we place limits (if at all)?<br /><br />*This video includes a paid sponsor. This sponsor was not involved in the making of the video, nor did they write any of the script. All portions of the advertisement are located at the end of the video, which was paid for as sponsored advertising content. This channel is not directly affiliated with the sponsored company, but does explicitly endorse their product after testing it firsthand.
