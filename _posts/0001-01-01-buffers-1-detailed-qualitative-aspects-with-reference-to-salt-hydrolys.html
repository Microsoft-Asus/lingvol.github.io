This is the first of three videos that I produced to cover the chemistry of Buffers. This one looks in considerable detail at the main qualitative aspects of buffers. It considers how acid and alkaline buffers are prepared and how they manage to prevent sudden large pH changes in solution. The actions and uses of buffers in the human body are considered and explained. The importance of buffering in the EDTA titration to investigate hardness in water is also considered in detail. Salt hydrolysis has been tagged along with buffers here - emerging by way of explaining how the half equivalence point in a weak acid + strong base titration may be used to find the Ka value of the weak acid. The second video helps to identify strategies for answering buffer question - which are then tackled in video 3.
