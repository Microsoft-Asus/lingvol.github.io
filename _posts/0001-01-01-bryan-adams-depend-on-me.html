Depend On Me. From the classic album “Waking Up The Neighbours”, Bryan is singing LIVE to the original TV track. <br /><br />Filmed on his iPhone, September 2020<br /><br />When you're losin' direction<br />Baby you can depend on me<br />For a little love and affection - you can depend on me<br />If ya feel broken hearted and you just can't get started<br />You can depend on me<br />Ya know it's never easy and when you're feelin' blue<br />There'll be times you feel so empty ya sometimes I feel it 2<br /><br />Like sister to brother - father to mother<br />We live for each other - we're lover to lover<br />As deep as an ocean - filled with emotion<br />I'm forever open - can't you see<br />Baby you can depend on me<br />Depend on me - depend on me<br /><br />For someone to rely on and a shoulder to cry on<br />You can depend on me<br />If you're in need of some kindness<br />And you can't seem to find it - you can depend on me<br />Well there ain't no need to worry you know we'll get along<br />Those dark clouds may surround you<br />But together we'll be strong<br /><br />Your love is a guiding light<br />I've been watchin' it shine - shine on baby<br />When hard times are all around<br /><br />And there's miles and miles of dirty road - depend on me<br />There's no need to carry that heavy load - depend on me<br />When hope is gone and all is lost<br />Just reach out - take my hand<br />I'll be there - I'll be your man<br /><br />You can depend on me…<br /><br />#bryanadamsdependonme #bryanadamswakinguptheneighbours
