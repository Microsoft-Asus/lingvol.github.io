From Further Listening 1995~1997<br /><br />(Neil's coment)<br /><br />This dates back to the previous year.It's a very romantic song.It's a bit Beatle-y.I wrote it on the piano at home,and then I came up with the words at the end of 1994 on the Discovery tour.I play the guitar on the record. I like the 'ooooo's. I don't think this sounds much like any of our records. It's a rock ballad. It's about the end of a relationship,looking back at the start of the relationship.It's a reminding someone why you were in love in the first place. It's autobiographical.<br /><br />(This coment from Album card of Bilingual. Sorry my English is not perfect.)
