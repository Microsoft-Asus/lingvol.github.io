Ornamental Penmanship is the ultimate script for many of that love movement writing from the golden age of penmanship. I've started to focus more on Ornamental and I realized how different the rhythm of Ornamental is than Business Penmanship, which is a script I've spent so much time with the past 3 years. In this video I try to show the different in movement between these two scripts which looks subtle visually, but is dramatically different in execution and feeling.<br /><br />Check out my website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://perfectbiscuits.com">http://perfectbiscuits.com</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: @PerfectBiscuits
