Hey everyone,<br />today I'm starting a new series here on this channel which is going to be all about how to start out with Copics. Part 1 shall help you to find the Copic marker type which suits you best. While it's true that most people use Sketch markers, they are neither the cheapest nor do you have to use them. Everyone should purchase the marker type which is best for him/her. There will be 4 parts in total and they will be uploaded on a weekly basis.<br /><br />Contents of this video:<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:24 Introduction of the markers<br />02:25 Basic differences between the markers<br />05:15 Required qualities in markers<br />10:21 Metaphor to demonstrate that Ciaos are the cheapest markers<br />13:08 Summary of the strong and weak points of all markers<br />16:49 Multiliners<br />19:43 Outro<br /><br /><br />Links from the End Card:<br />Copic Haul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xKkyq9d9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xKkyq9d9M</a><br />One Piece Coloring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXsVQFAK2-c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXsVQFAK2-c</a><br /><br />End Card Music:<br />&quot;Clean Soul&quot; by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link to the song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/wordpress/2013/06/clean-soul/">http://incompetech.com/wordpress/2013/06/clean-soul/</a><br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br /><br />Creative Commons Legal Code:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode</a><br />Creative Commons Licence:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Isomon
