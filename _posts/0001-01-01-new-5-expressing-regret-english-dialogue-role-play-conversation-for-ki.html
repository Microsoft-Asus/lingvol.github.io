Is that broken?<br />John: Yeah, a wheel fell out.<br />Roy: Oh, no, you can’t ride it then?<br />John: No, I don’t think so. This skateboard was my favorite!<br />Roy: Why don’t you take it to a repair shop? I think they will repair it for you.<br />John: Well, I wish they will be able to fix it. Roy, you don’t look too happy. What’s wrong? <br />Roy: I messed up on my exam. Why did I take a test without any preparation?<br />John: What? The genius boy Roy ruined an exam?<br />Roy: Yes… I got two questions wrong. I think I should be well prepared next time. <br />Roy&amp;John: (Sigh..)<br /><br />John: Hey Kevin, what happened to you? You look really angry.<br />Kevin: My naughty sister broke my cell phone screen. Look at this!<br />John: Wow, it’s completely cracked !<br />Roy: Your sister? Mary? She looked very quiet the last time I saw her.<br />Kevin: You don’t know what you are talking about. She is such a troublemaker. I will do something about Mary!<br />Roy: Give your phone to a service center. They will repair it quickly.<br />Kevin: I just came back from there, but it was closed down.<br />John: What? Today is a weekday!<br />Kevin: They were under construction. Oh, my goodness! Nothing is working out today!<br />John: Oh, no… It’s one of your bad days too. I’m so sorry.<br /><br />Kevin: Oh, no! It’s raining!<br />Roy: Oh, no! We are soaking wet! Let’s quickly get inside.<br />John: What a horrible day for all of us!<br /><br />Thanks for checking out the &quot;English Singsing&quot;.<br />© Amanta Inc.
