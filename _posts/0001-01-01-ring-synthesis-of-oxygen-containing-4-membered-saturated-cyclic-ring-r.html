This video lecture in the series of ring synthesis provides a edge cutting knowledge for disconnection and synthesis of oxygen containing 4 member saturated heterocyclic ring i. e. Oxetane. Chemist can understand the basic concept lying in disconnection of such strained molecules.<br /><br /><br />This is Dr. Harish Mudila, bringing you the concept of reterosynthesis, in a very lucid manner with example so that basic concepts can be understood.<br /><br /><br />For more information you can post your queries on chemystery.masters.19@gmail.com or watsapp no. 9463796257<br /><br /><br />#Retrosynthesis #Disconnection  #Ringsynthesis #Oxetanedisconnection
