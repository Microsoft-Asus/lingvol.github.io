{% raw %}Don't you think that the English spoken by the man in this video is difficult to understand? The reason is that the reading speed is fast and the sounds of the words before and after are partly connected. The phenomenon in which the sounds of the preceding and following words are connected and sound like one sound is called &quot;linking (Connected Speech)&quot;.<br /><br />There are many different types of linking, but the quickest way to master linking is to listen to a lot of examples and get used to them, rather than learn each pattern.<br /><br />There are many short phrases in this video made up of 2 to 8 words, but they can be difficult to understand because of “linking”. If you can understand these phrases, it will be easier to understand the English spoken by native speakers.{% endraw %}
