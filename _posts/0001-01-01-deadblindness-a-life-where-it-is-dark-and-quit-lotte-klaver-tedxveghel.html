{% raw %}At the age of 17, you are told that you have Usher's syndrome, a genetic disease. Not only you, but also your youngest sister gets the same, horrible message. The Usher bomb has been dropped and suddenly becomes part of your daily life. <br /><br />Every day your vision and hearing deteriorates. <br />Silence - darkness.<br /><br />What is Usher? Is there a cure? What can be done about it, but especially how do you deal with it when you are told that your life will inevitably change within 10 years! <br />DEAFBLINDNESS! <br />How do you look to the future when you get this message? 20 years<br />two sisters, one older, one younger<br />photographer<br /><br />When she started her study as photographer, she learned that she suffered from Usher Syndrome, an incurable genetic disease that causes deafness and blindness. She was 17 at that moment.<br />Also her youngest sister Roos, at that moment 15, got the same message. <br /><br />At this moment she travels, lives life at the fullest and uses her voice to create awareness for a disease that has been known and identified for over 100 years but not cure has been found (yet). This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
