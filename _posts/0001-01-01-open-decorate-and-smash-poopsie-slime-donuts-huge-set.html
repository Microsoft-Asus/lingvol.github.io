Today we have an amazing and huge unboxing - Poopsie Slime Smash! We'll make crunchy donut slime! First step is decorating with sprinkles and frosting. Second - smashing the donut! And third - storing it in a special donut case! The box includes 6 slimes and 5 glitter toppings. Each box has four donuts and there are 4 series in total - Rainbow Neapolitan, Berry Blitz, Candy Craze and Sprinkle Spree.<br /><br />1:09 - The first box is the Sprinkle Spree series. And here are our delicious donuts that look very realistic! In the set we will find bags with frosting, 5 bags with glitter, and of course donuts! Let's start examining our donuts and turning them into slime! To do this, add the frosting, sprinkle with glitter and smash them! We will store the slime in a container shaped like a donut. In the first set, we found very beautiful donuts: pink, yellow, blue and purple, and a lot of amazing glitter for decoration! By the way, you can cut each slime donut and find out what surprise is hidden inside! The first delicious set is open!<br /><br />8:43 - Opening our second delicious set! This is the Rainbow Neapolitan collection. Inside there is a standard set of bags with decor. The most interesting part is our donuts!
