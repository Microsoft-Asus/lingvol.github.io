Thanks to World of Tanks for sponsoring this<br />video. Follow the link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tanks.ly/35OlHcb">https://tanks.ly/35OlHcb</a> and use the code<br />“TANKTASTIC” to receive 7 premium days, 500 Gold, and a premium T-127<br />tank. For new accounts only.<br /><br />At last! I did take the tank out for a spin and what a spin!! The tank is capable of going over branches, stones, cliffs, I'm genuinely surprised of how well it performed on the field. After last video I swapped the two VESCs for an Odrive with one encoder for each motor and that made a huge difference on the low speed torque of the motors. I haven't mastered the Odrive yet so I had to reset it a few times during the test but this test has demonstrated that those motors are powerful enough. I may even add an extra reduction step in the future just to be able to pull things or maybe use it to remove snow. Please leave in the comments what you think I should be adding next to the tank as it will probably take a bit of time until you see this tank again on the channel. Enjoy!!<br /><br />All the sprocket brackets and spacers where printed with Matterhackers NylonX on the PulseXE, you can find it here:<br />(affiliate link) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LSzveK">https://bit.ly/2LSzveK</a><br /><br />If you want to support this channel you can do it here:<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ivanmiranda">https://www.patreon.com/ivanmiranda</a><br />Merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/ivan-miranda">https://www.bonfire.com/store/ivan-miranda</a><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/IvanMirandacom">https://www.paypal.me/IvanMirandacom</a><br /><br />For regular updates on my projects follow me on:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/adnarimnavi">https://www.instagram.com/adnarimnavi</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/adnarimnavi">https://www.twitter.com/adnarimnavi</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/adnarimnavi/">https://www.facebook.com/adnarimnavi/</a>
