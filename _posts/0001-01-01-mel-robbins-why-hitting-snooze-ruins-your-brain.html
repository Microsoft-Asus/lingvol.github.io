You don't need me to tell you that hitting the snooze button once your alarm goes off doesn't make it any easier to wake up. In fact, you probably feel more anxious, less productive, and more tired by the time you wake up after hitting snooze multiple times. <br /><br />In this video I'll explain why even though it may seem impossible to get up after hearing the alarm once, it's necessary. Your brain relies on sleep cycles to feel refreshed and energized. Once you wake up and then go back to sleep, you hijack your brain and tell it that it needs at LEAST one more hour of sleep. <br /><br />So, if you don't have another hour in the day to spare (you don't), get up and get started. It will be hard at first, but soon you'll understand that the key to productivity is simply getting up on time. Do this for a week and watch how your life improves and your to-do list shrinks.
