Album: Magnum Opus<br /><br />Top Quality was an American rapper formally signed to RCA Records in the early 1990s. He was the first rapper from White Plains to get a major label record deal. <br /><br />After appearing in The Source magazine's Unsigned Hype, a column dedicated to finding unsigned talent, Top Quality eventually caught the eye of EPMD's Parrish &quot;PMD&quot; Smith, who made him a member of the rap collective Hit Squad and was subsequently signed a deal with RCA Records. His debut album, Magnum Opus was released in November 1993 and was executively produced by Smith himself. The album, however, was a commercial failure. Unlike other Hit Squad releases at the time, Magnum Opus failed to sell many copies and peaked at only 95 on the Billboard R&amp;B charts.<br /><br />After being released from RCA, Top Quality appeared on PMD's Shade Business in 1994 and 3rd Eye's Planets in 1998, but he has not been heard of since.<br /><br />Visit us on<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/marlon.posada.79">https://www.facebook.com/marlon.posada.79</a>
