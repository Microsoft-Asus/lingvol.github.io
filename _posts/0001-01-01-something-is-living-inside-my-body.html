She is 5 years older than me. I wanted to be her friend but she was so mean to me. You won’t believe the mean things she has done to me.<br /><br />But before I go on, make sure you like and subscribe and hit that notification bell so you don’t miss out on any more crazy stories!!<br /><br />It all started the day I was born. Mom and Dad rushed to the hospital the morning I was born. My sister Louise stayed at home with my Grandma. Later in the afternoon, Grandma brought Louise to see me. She took one look at me and said,<br /><br />“It's a boy!”<br /><br />“Yes.” Smiled Mom and Dad. “Meet your baby brother Joe.”<br /><br />“But I don’t want a baby brother!” Wailed Louise. “I want a baby sister!”<br /><br />From that moment on she never let me forget that she wanted a baby sister. Whenever I tried to play with her, she would tell me to go away. <br /><br />“You can’t play this game.” She would say. “This game is only for girls.”<br /><br />Louise sometimes had her friends over to our house to play. They would go into her bedroom and shut the door so that I couldn’t come in to play. One time Louise was playing “tea party” with her friends. She had plates with cookies on and glasses of lemonade. I wanted to play too. I pushed the door open so hard that I tumbled into the room and fell on top of the plates and glasses. Louise started shouting and crying. Mom came running upstairs. <br /><br />“Oh what have you done Joe?” She asked.<br /><br />“He’s ruining everything Mom.” cried Louise.<br /><br />With that Mom picked me up and took me downstairs to sit in the room with her. It wasn’t fair. I told Mom it was only an accident but she didn’t believe me. <br /><br />Sometimes Mom would ask Louise to play with me whilst she made dinner. I was so happy. But Louise didn’t speak to me. She just put the TV on and ignored me. <br /><br />Louise had lots of friends because she went to a big school with lots of students. I couldn’t wait to start school. Then I would get lots of friends too. Finally the day came. My first day at school. I woke up early and ate my breakfast. Mom told Louise and I to get into the car whilst she locked up the house. As we waited for Mom I smiled excitedly at Louise.
