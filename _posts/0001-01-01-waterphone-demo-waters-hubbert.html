{% raw %}I’m really, really excited by this new official Richard Waters’ waterphone made by Brooks Hubbert. Brooks is an amazing musician and instrument builder who knew and worked with Richard. This new bass waterphone is so very resonant, responsive and expressive! It is a dream to play. For a longer audio demonstration go to:<br />soundcloud.com/user7621213/hubbert-waters-waterphone-demo<br />You may contact Brooks for more information at waterphoneman@gmail.com{% endraw %}
