The poet Maya Angelou described &quot;Troubled Water&quot; as one of Margaret Bonds masterpieces. Based on the spiritual &quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, Margaret Bonds conveys the power, and the emotional history of a form of communication used between slaves. A very spiritual piece, and one of my favorites. It appears on my CD West of the Sun.
