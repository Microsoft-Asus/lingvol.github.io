But if you play two notes really close to each other - having a frequency of less than about 30 Hz between them, like a semitone – then we don’t hear two distinct pitches. Instead we hear the a single note at the average frequency, but with a volume which goes up and down over time. This variance in volume is called a ‘beat’ – and creates a ‘wah-wah-wah’ sound. And these beats happen at the difference in frequencies between the notes.
