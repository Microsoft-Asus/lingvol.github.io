Salvagnini is revolutionizing traditional manufacturing concepts, extending the panel bender’s typical range of application and pushing the boundaries of traditional bending potential.<br />The Salvagnini  P2lean panel bender is essentially a sheet metal processing centre capable of producing a wide range of items, making it a great tool for anyone, even businesses who have never contemplated the panel bender as their ideal type of bending machine.<br />The P2lean is also perfectly in line with market expectations when it comes to energy consumption: in this is a direct consequence of the machine’s new electric actuator, and the new finite element analysis of the structure.
