{% raw %}Here's a tutorial I made to convert a Bird Scooter for personal use.<br /><br />Now it is generally VERY plug and play, but if you want to use some of the more advanced features you'll need to use a bluetooth app.<br /><br />Also, I mention that I used a &quot;Pro&quot; board as a replacement so I can see my speed.  The &quot;Pro&quot; board actually requires a different firmware to fully function.  I used a YouTube guide here to resolve that: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZrhElmBTXU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZrhElmBTXU</a><br /><br />Good luck!{% endraw %}
