{% raw %}In this dramatic before and after, see how designer Alicia Sass of Harrison Fae Design brought a dated bungalow into the present. Before, the closed-off space was adorned with tacky wallpaper, linoleum flooring, pink carpet and turquoise paint, which didn't suit the homeowner's modern taste. Alicia knocked down the walls on the main floor, creating an open-concept layout for the family of three. The white and walnut wood kitchen is a cooking enthusiast's dream with integrated appliances and ample storage, while jewel-like light fixtures add a dose of sparkle. Plus, the bedrooms' neutral palettes make them stylish for years to come. <br /><br />SOURCES:<br />Design, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.harrisonfae.ca/">https://www.harrisonfae.ca/</a><br />Kitchen sink &amp; faucet by Blanco.
