This video will give you 5 tips to create your own guitar-strumming patterns with an Ample Guitar VST. Few years ago, I was maybe just like you : a complete beginner with Ample Sound, and my creations didn't sound right. <br /><br />First tip is... use barre chords. Although it can't be a general rule (as every music is different), barre chords have less sustain that open chords. They are usually recommended for rhythm guitar.<br /><br />Second tip is : if you want to play with open strings, you can use a capo. A capo reduces the sustain of the open chords. Again, every song is different, but it can help.<br /><br />Third tip : learn to separate the bass note from the rest of the chord. When a guitarist strums a chord, he or she usually doesn't strum all the strings... all the time (in general). So your guitar-strumming pattern can be more realistic if you play a root note, then you play downward... then root note etc.<br /><br />Fourth tip : alternate between &quot;PALM-MUTE-MODE&quot; and &quot;SUSTAIN-MODE&quot;. Using the palm of your hand to block the strings can help you get a better song.<br /><br />Last tip : when you play a chord, try to remove just one finger, and you change the way it sounds. Doing so, you can create melodies easily. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE CONTENT ON GUITAR VSTs <br />====<br />How to strum an Ample Sound VST : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kO4wHkbs0h0">https://youtu.be/kO4wHkbs0h0</a><br /><br />How to write a riff in Riffer : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/P8fezFLpd8E">https://youtu.be/P8fezFLpd8E</a><br /><br />SUPPORT THE CHANNEL<br />===<br />Listen to my band here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zQBfsNdLjX4">https://youtu.be/zQBfsNdLjX4</a><br /><br />More at : yugen-music.com
