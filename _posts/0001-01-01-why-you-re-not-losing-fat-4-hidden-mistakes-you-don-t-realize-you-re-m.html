Why can’t I lose weight, why can’t I lose belly fat, and why am I not losing fat on a calorie deficit are a few questions we will hope to resolve in this video. Many people put a lot of time into how to lose body fat, but do not see any progress. Inevitably, they eventually give up. The reason people don’t lose body weight and can’t lose belly fat is not genetic, because of metabolism, or age… And in this video I will go over a few common mistakes after which correcting will allow you to start burning stubborn body fat and see the results your hard work deserves.<br /><br />First and foremost, caloric intake is the key factor in determining body weight. You may be asking: what should I eat to lose fat? Many people claim they eat less calories than they actually do. Research in the field shows that most people significantly underestimate their calorie intake, and thus can’t lose fat. So, how can you avoid this costly mistake and how to lose fat quickly? Simply use a food scale to weight the food you are going to eat. You should also use an application like MyFitnessPal to track the calories in these foods. This will give you a better sense of the actual calories you are eating and allow you to make adjustments as you figure out how to eat to lose fat. The last thing to remember is seemingly small number of hidden calories, such as a little oil, salad dressing, ketchup, or bite of a chocolate bar which can add up to hundreds of calories altogether and prevent you from attaining your weight loss goals. <br /> <br />What else can you do to burn fat, especially fat below the belly button and why can’t you lose weight? Well, you need to keep track of your progress and the way to do that is weighing yourself. As shown in the video, you have to be consistent in the taking your body weight.You write down your body weight each day and average each set weekly to account for daily fluctuations. Comparing weekly averages can help you decide what step to take to keep inline with your weight loss goals. <br /><br />The best way to lose weight fast is to avoid overeating. Many people eat back the calories they have burned after an intense workout, especially if they have done cardio. This can prevent fat loss altogether. This is even worse, because people tend to significantly overestimate the calories they burn in a workout. Even machines designed to do so are not reliable and tend to overestimate the calories used up in a workout routine. A better method would be to set daily calorie limits and weekly workout routines and stick to them as you track your average weekly weight – you can decrease caloric intake or increase weekly cardio if you are not losing weight as quickly as you want to be. <br /><br />What is another common mistake you might be making that is preventing you from losing body weight, including stubborn belly fat or love handles? Relying on the scale to tracking weight loss is a big mistake. If you are new to training, coming back from an extended leave, or just getting serious about working out, you may be losing fat and gaining muscle – this may look like a stable body weight. But in reality, you are undergoing body recomposition. If your waist girth has decreased, arm girth is greater, and you are lifting more in the gym, despite weighing the same amount, then you can rest assured that you are making progress and have replaced body fat, especially fat on the stomach with lean muscle mass. <br /><br />It’s crucial that you take the time to track all the necessary variables along your journey. This is why in my Built With Science programs, you not only get step-by-step training and nutrition programs, but you’ll also get access to multiple tracking softwares that I’ve built so that you can easily track your workouts, your diet, and basically everything you need along your fat loss journey.
