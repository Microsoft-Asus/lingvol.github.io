Can using law school training improve how you order a pizza? Law Professor Steve Reed believes so.<br /><br /><br /><br />Using his expertise as a Clinical Professor of Law at Northwestern Law and as the Assistant Director at the Entrepreneurship Law Center, Steve Reed will demonstrate the benefits (and drawbacks) of legal thinking and analysis when applied to everyday life.<br /><br />Steve Reed is a Clinical Professor of Law, the Assistant Director of the Entrepreneurship Law Center, and Co-Director of the JD-MBA Program at Northwestern University School of Law. In the clinical program of the Entrepreneurship Law Center, Reed works with students to represent start-ups, more mature companies and social entrepreneurs in a variety of transactional matters. In the classroom, he teaches Business Associations, Advanced Corporate Law and Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, and co-teaches Entrepreneurship Law. Reed also co-teaches Law and the Entrepreneur, a Massive Open Online Course offered by Northwestern University and Coursera that attracted over 35,000 students worldwide in its first session.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
