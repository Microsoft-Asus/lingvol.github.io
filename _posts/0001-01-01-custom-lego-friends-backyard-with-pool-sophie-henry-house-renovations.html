And the renovations continue! Sophie &amp; Henry's backyard needs an entire overhaul after being stomped around on by all the animals from the impromptu pet rescue. So we're making a huge backyard and you're all invited! Of course there's going to be a pool (and of course I'm going to fill it with water), but what else will there be? Will it be silly or sensible? Check out the speed build and see! Let me know in the comments what else you think should be included in the backyard for next time. Sophie &amp; Henry and the triplets are going to have such a great time in their new custom Lego backyard. <br /><br />And don't forget that you can also get a cool ellieV toys t-shirt and other stuff from here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch</a><br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/mPFBb1">https://goo.gl/mPFBb1</a><br /><br />Lots more ellieV toys videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/CXhf59">https://goo.gl/CXhf59</a><br />Sylvanian Families / Calico Critters videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr">http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr</a><br />Lego Friends videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xbV84E">https://goo.gl/xbV84E</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and like if you enjoy - I appreciate every single one of your views!<br /><br />Music - Carolina Rag (audioblocks)
