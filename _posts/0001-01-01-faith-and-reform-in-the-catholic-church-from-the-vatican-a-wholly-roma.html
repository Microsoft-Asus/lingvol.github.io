And will he seek to reform and modernise or will he maintain 'business as usual'? In the coming and going between the faithful and the faithless, we examine how the battle for hearts, minds and souls, is more than just a numbers game. Joining us in Vatican City to discuss the present issues and future direction for the Roman Catholic Church are: Marco Tosatti, writer for La Stampa, and author of several books on religion, including John Paul II: Portrait of a Pontiff; Father Norman Tanner, a Jesuit Priest, and author of New Short History of the Catholic Church; and Marco Politi, a journalist and author of Joseph Ratzinger - Crisis of a Papacy.
