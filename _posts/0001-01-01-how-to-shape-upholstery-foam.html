{% raw %}Upholstery foam can be cut and then shaped with an electric or air tool, such as an angle die grinder or drill with an abrasive pad. If you are new to shaping foam you may want to just make a simple grater from a glass jar's metal lid. This hand made tool should eliminate the possibility of accidentally cutting gouges out of your foam when shaping it with a high speed tool. In this video we will show you the steps required to shape or sculpt foam to the desired shape and size.<br /><br />MATERIALS &amp; TOOLS USED IN THIS VIDEO:<br />Sailrite® Blade Foam Saw V2 with Carrying Case - Item # 121244: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sailrite.com/Sailrite-Blade-8-Foam-Cutter-with-Carrying-Case-110V">https://www.sailrite.com/Sailrite-Blade-8-Foam-Cutter-with-Carrying-Case-110V</a><br />Medium Density Polyurethane Antimicrobial Foam (Medium) 4&quot; x 24&quot; x 80&quot; - Item # 184M2480: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sailrite.com/Foam-and-Pillows">https://www.sailrite.com/Foam-and-Pillows</a><br />Foam Lock Spray Adhesive 12oz - Item # 120464: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sailrite.com/NG633-Foam-Lock-Spray-Adhesive-12oz">https://www.sailrite.com/NG633-Foam-Lock-Spray-Adhesive-12oz</a><br />Fabric Backed Sew Foam 58&quot; - ¼” Item # 121506 or ½” Item # 121507: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sailrite.com/Fabric-Backed-1-2-Sew-Foam-58">https://www.sailrite.com/Fabric-Backed-1-2-Sew-Foam-58</a>{% endraw %}
