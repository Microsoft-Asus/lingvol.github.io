Portals to the Absolute: Part I: The first part of this You Tube explores Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj as a Teaching Master. Nisargadatta Maharaj in the beginning and early phases pointed students to the I Am, Beingness, Consciousness, Awareness, or Nothingness as a Portal to the Absolute.<br /><br /> As a cautionary note oftentimes Portals and states can become “stuck” points that both “spiritual practitioners” and students, as well as &quot;teachers&quot; can unknowingly and habitually nest in. <br /><br />Zen Saying: “You never want to nest in any state”<br /><br />For this reason the last section of this YouTube begins to deconstruct Portals which are mistakenly confused as being the Absolute.<br /><br />All Portals, and “spiritual experiences” are appearances or labels which appear to appear in the Dream-Illusion. Eventually these Portals including emptiness, consciousness, the I Am awareness, energy or shakti, beingness, presence, light, and vibration… … dissolve… Prior to or without these Portals is the Absolute…The Nameless Absolute…THAT<br /><br /> This You Tube is offered at the feet of my Guru and Mentor Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, whose meetings with him were truly the ultimate “luck-out”.<br /><br />May Maharaj’s grace and clarity blanket your heart and mind.<br /><br />Your Mirage brother<br /><br />Stephen (Narayan)<br /><br /> For more information and downloads go to www.miragelibrary.com<br /><br />All of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj’s books are available through the devotion of Acorn Press (www.acornpressonline.com) or at Amazon.com
