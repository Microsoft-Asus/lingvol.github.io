{% raw %}Here David Wood presents a case for the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Jesus Christ explicitly claimed to be the Son of God:<br /><br />&quot; But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” And Jesus said, “I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” &quot; (Mark 14:61-62, NASB)<br /><br />&quot; And they all said, “Are You the Son of God, then?” And He said to them, “Yes, I am.” &quot; (Luke 22:70, NASB)<br /><br />&quot; do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? &quot; (John 10:36, NASB)<br /><br />Jesus being the Son of God means Deity / equality with God:<br /><br />&quot; For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. &quot; (John 5:18, NASB){% endraw %}
