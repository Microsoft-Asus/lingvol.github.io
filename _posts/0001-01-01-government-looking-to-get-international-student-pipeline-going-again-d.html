{% raw %}The Morrison government may be able to open its borders to international students should the states and territories increase their caps in the new year, but the focus is very much on returning Australians for Christmas, says Dan Tehan.<br /><br />The education minister told Sky News the international student market is, of course, a very lucrative one for Australia as it creates 250,000 domestic jobs.<br /><br />“We want to get that pipeline going again,” Mr Tehan said.<br /><br />“But still our focus – and especially in the lead up to Christmas – is returning Australians, as I think it should be.”{% endraw %}
