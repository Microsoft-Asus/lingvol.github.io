{% raw %}This is a story about a girl who had complications when she was a child and had to take blood thinners since she was a child. But what would she do when her wisdom tooth starting hurting? She went to so many dentists and other oral surgeons to get some help and advised her to not remove it. Except for one who said it was going to be okay. When she got it removed, everything seemed fine until a few days after. She started to bleed profusely and had to be rushed to several hospitals losing half of her blood count, suffering from 2 seizures and a heart attack too. She suffered PTSD from it and developed an unhealthy attachment to her blanket. IT took a long time and therapy for her to recover but she remains positive that she will. <br /><br />We chose this story because we want to encourage people to speak up if something similar has happened to them and to seek help if they're still in such a situation. We hope this video will encourage people to feel empathy and compassion for those who have gone through such experiences. And we hope that it will encourage us all to do what we can to prevent these things from happening. Even if it does happen we want to encourage people to speak up for their own safety<br /><br />Submit your story at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://community02.com/story/new">https://community02.com/story/new</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/minutevideos.productions">https://www.facebook.com/minutevideos.productions</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/minutevideosdotcom">http://www.instagram.com/minutevideosdotcom</a><br />Support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/minutevideos">https://www.patreon.com/minutevideos</a>{% endraw %}
