Quantum Immortality - is it real? Quantum mechanics shows that all particles are not particles at all but really waves of probabilities. There are two common interpretations of how these waves become distinct- one is the &quot;many worlds theory.&quot;  <br /><br />The most conventional interpretation is called the Copenhagen interpretation, and it says that the probability wave collapses, and the particles become distinct at the moment they are observed. It should be noted that these observations are measurements and do not necessarily require a conscious observer.  <br /><br />A competing interpretation to this is called the many worlds interpretation. It postulates that no collapse actually occurs…That everything in the entire universe is wave function and remains a wave function. This interpretation rejects the idea wave function &quot;collapse&quot; altogether. According to this, probability waves never collapse but what we observe as a distinct reality only occurs for us in this reality, but does not collapse in another reality. So reality in continually branching off into parallel worlds whenever a measurement or observation occurs. <br /><br />This is why it is called the many worlds interpretation because as wave collapse occurs due to observations, a parallel universe is created where wave collapse does not occur.  This theory introduces the seemingly absurd complication of creating a near infinite number of parallel worlds, so why is it so widely embraced by physicists?  Proponents argue that this interpretation actually simplifies and explains the seeming randomness of quantum physics.  Since all possibilities are potentially real in various branches of parallel universes, there is no randomness. There is no chance. All possibilities occur in numerous parallel realities.  It only seems random to us because we experience reality in only one of the branches.  <br /><br />All possible alternate histories and futures are equally real and can exist in parallel.  So every time you had a brush with death, you died in one of the parallel realities, but the only reality where you remained conscious is the only reality that you are aware of – this reality.  In that other reality, they buried you, and your loved ones came to your funeral.  But as far as you know, you have always been alive.  <br /><br />Some have extrapolated this concept to mean that Whenever you might die, there will be another universe in which you’re still alive, because some quantum event (even if astronomically unlikely) will save you from death? This is the concept behind quantum immortality.  If this theory is true, it would mean that there is a version of reality where any of your loved ones who may have died in your reality here, are alive and well. <br /><br />Could quantum mechanics in some way be actually verifying the idea of an immortal consciousness, or even an immortal soul, which many people believe in?  It’s important to distinguish the difference between an immortal consciousness and immortal soul. If a soul is defined as disembodied consciousness, then that’s not what would happen in the many worlds theory.  Your consciousness is always attached to your body.  And from the perspective of the conscious person, nothing happened.  He or she never died.  <br /><br />In fact, if you can recall being in a close call, where you almost got killed, then almost certainly, you did get killed in a parallel reality, but your consciousness survived in this reality where you did not get killed.  Hugh Everrett who proposed the many worlds idea in 1957 reportedly believed in this kind of “quantum immortality” and thought he would continue to live forever. In our reality, of course He died - suddenly of a heart attack in 1982.  <br /><br />But there are some issues with this theory. For one thing many worlds is not embraced by all physicists, but even the Copenhagen interpretation is not a majority consensus among physicists. Also, quantum events must obey conservation laws. You can’t cheat science in order to cheat death.  So for example, if you fall out of a 40 story building, there could be zero chance scientifically that you survive in any reality.  It is also possible that it is scientifically impossible for you to survive as a human beyond say 150 years.   <br /><br />And another issue pointed out by Max Tegmark is that this type of branching into multiverses only occurs where there is a binary option, in other words when the options are that you die instantly or survive. If your consciousness slowly fades away, for example a slow deterioration from old age, or due to cancer, then this interpretation likely would not apply.  And of course, all bets are off if the many worlds interpretation is proven incorrect.  <br /><br />But if this theory is true, then anyone that has lost a loved one, can take some comfort knowing that the person whom you’ve been grieving about for years, is in fact alive and well in a parallel reality of the cosmos. We just don’t have access to that reality.  At least no access that we are aware of.     <br /><br />#quantumimmortality
