Pastor Don Mackintosh, Pastor of the Weimar Campus Church, continues his Sabbath Series in giving part 1 of studying Isaiah 58:13 and 14. God has given us the Sabbath and many blessings when we honor the Sabbath.  But there are some things we need to do in order to acquire the blessings.  Pastor Don show us how. Quality and sound of the program will differ due to the outdoor nature of the video.
