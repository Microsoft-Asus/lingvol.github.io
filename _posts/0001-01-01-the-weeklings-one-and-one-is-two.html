So, It's not just a phobia!  I was contacted by the guy in the clown suit, and told to meet him downtown in front of the bakery.  When I arrived, he was standing next to an old Volkswagon beetle.  As he handed me a bag, the car door opened and suddenly I was surrounded by about 15 clowns that had just exited the vehicle!  The pies started flying but I was able to escape.  I don't understand what's going on, but I bloody well intend to find out!  In the meantime, here is another excerpt from &quot; the lost tapes &quot;!  For all that I've gone through, I hope that you enjoy these rare treats! Here are -The Weeklings- with &quot;One and One is Two&quot;<br />Glen Burtnik - (Lefty Weekling) <br />Bob Burger - (Zeek Weekling) <br />John Merjave - (Rocky Weekling) <br />Dave Anthony - (Ramblin' Dave Weekling)
