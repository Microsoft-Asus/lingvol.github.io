The provider package offers incredibly flexible and powerful state management solutions for Flutter.  In this series we take a look at the different kind of providers available in the provider package as well as different ways to import them into our widgets.<br /><br />The first part of the series covers Change Notifier Provider which provides a great way to link your widgets to a backend state class as well as non-reactive data solutions such as Shared Preferences, SQLLite, and REST APIs.<br /><br />Github: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/nhandrew/WaxApplication">https://github.com/nhandrew/WaxApplication</a><br /><br />Socal Media:<br />Twitter: @andyjulow<br /><br />Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andyjulow">https://www.patreon.com/andyjulow</a>
