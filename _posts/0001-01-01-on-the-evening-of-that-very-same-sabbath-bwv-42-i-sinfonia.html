On the evening of that very same Sabbath, BWV 42<br />Am Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats (On the evening, however, of the same Sabbath), BWV 42, is a church cantata composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. He wrote it in Leipzig for the first Sunday after Easter. It was first performed on 8 April 1725. The cantata in seven movements was originally scored for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass soloists, a four-part choir only in the closing chorale, two oboes, bassoon, two violins, viola and basso continuo. /<br /><br />Discover music ranging from epic symphonies to relaxing piano tracks and everything in between.<br /><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+MusicITVPYouTubeAudioLibrary">https://plus.google.com/+MusicITVPYouTubeAudioLibrary</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MusicITVP">https://www.youtube.com/user/MusicITVP</a>
