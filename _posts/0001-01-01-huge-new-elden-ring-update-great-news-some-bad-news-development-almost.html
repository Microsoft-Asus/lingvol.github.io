Hey everyone, some more info dropped last night on Elden Ring! So the Game Awards take place on December 10th, there's a really good chance we'll see Elden Ring in action! FINALLY! This news comes from Lance Mcdonald, a software sleuth, who has various connections in the video game world. He says he got word that Fromsoftware has hired contractors to come in and finish the game. These guys only come in at the end of games development cycle, so that it GREAT NEWS for us! Also, he says it's 100% ready to show to the public. Meaning if these software contractors have been hired, and they only show up at the end of games, we could definitely see Elden Ring GAMEPLAY in 6 DAYS! He also stated that its release would not be until 2021. That's the bad news, still so much waiting, but at least we know it's almost done and keep those fingers crossed that we see it in 6 days at the game awards! and 1 last thing, he also said the game is GIANT in SIZE. I'm so excited and cannot wait!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hello, my channel is Games 4 days I like to have funny moments and just a good time gaming.
