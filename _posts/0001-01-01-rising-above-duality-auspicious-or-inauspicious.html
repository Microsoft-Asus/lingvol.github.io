The final demons in Durga Saptashati are Shumbh and Nishumbh. In the video of esoteric meaning of Durga Saptashati, I have talked about the various stages of progression on the spiritual path.  So two of the demons are shumbh and nishumbh. Shumbh is basically shubh (auspicious) and nishumbh is ashubh(inauspicious). Throughout our lives due to our conditioning or our superstitions or our own perspectives, we define certain things as shubh. We label certain occurrences in our lives, certain things in our lives as shubh.  These are auspicious and certain other things as ashubh. These are inauspicious. To get to mother divine, you have to rise above this very definition of what is auspicious and what is inauspicious. <br /><br />Everything is auspicious. What is not auspicious? If I am losing money in stock market, for example, it is inauspicious for me but somebody is gaining so it is auspicious for that person. So on the spiritual path when we progress you are so caught up in your world that you start thinking that if certain things are not going they way you want, you think it is inauspicious and you donâ€™t want it that way, But there is nothing like that.<br /><br />Listen to this insightful discourse by Om Swami to find out more.<br /><br />BREATHE / SMILE / LET GO<br />-----------------------<br />SUBSCRIBE to Om Swami channel for weekly dose of positive and practical thoughts on life, meditation, spirituality, relationships &amp; more! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/omswamitv">https://www.youtube.com/user/omswamitv</a><br />-----------------------<br />Want to connect &amp; explore more.
