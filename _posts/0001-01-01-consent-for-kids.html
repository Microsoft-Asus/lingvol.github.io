Consent is like being ruler of your own country...population: YOU.<br /><br />This is a smart, playful guide to consent and bodily autonomy.<br /><br />There is an upcoming book, based on this video that’s packed with bright and energetic illustrations. Readers will learn about boundaries and how to set them; signs of healthy (and unhealthy) relationships; ways to respect themselves and others; how to spot grooming behaviors; what to do if someone makes them feel uncomfortable or unsafe; and much more.<br /><br />Along the way, they’ll be encouraged to reflect on (and improve!) their own behavior and to practice consent in their daily lives.<br /><br />Whether you’re looking for a consent primer to share with a friend or searching for a way to talk<br /><br />to your child about what it means to be in control of their own body and respect others’, look no further! This humorous and insightful book from the co-creator of the viral “Tea Consent” video is the perfect teaching tool, conversation starter, and insightful, empowering resource for educators, kids, and families everywhere.<br /><br />To be released: Jan 7, 2020!
