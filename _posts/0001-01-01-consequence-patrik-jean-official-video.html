I really thought I got it right last time<br /><br />Now I’m sick of always splitting up apartments <br />Picking who were your friends, who were my friends <br />Don’t know if it’s bad luck or just bad bad judgement<br /><br />I would love to give all I’ve got<br />To be young to be dumb enough <br />Trust me I would love to love again <br />But I fucking hate the consequence <br />I’ve been burned, I’ve been hurt too much <br />Always fall, never call the bluff<br />Trust me I would love to love again <br />But I fucking hate the consequence<br /><br />I know it ain’t fair not to give you a chance <br />Because of things in my past<br />But I’m just cynical like that<br />You know I care, you also know that I’m scared <br />It’s never really worth it and it might sound sad<br /><br />But I’m sick of always splitting up apartments <br />Picking who were your friends, who were my friends <br />Don’t know if it’s bad luck or just bad bad judgement<br /><br />I would love to give all I’ve got<br />To be young to be dumb enough <br />Trust me I would love to love again <br />But I fucking hate the consequence <br />I’ve been burned, I’ve been hurt too much <br />Always fall, never call the bluff<br />Trust me I would love to love again <br />But I fucking hate the consequence<br />I hate the consequence<br />I hate the consequence<br />I’d love to love again but I<br />I fucking hate the consequence<br /><br />And so I’m pushing you away, yeah <br />Cause I don’t know how much more I can take<br /><br />I would love to give all I’ve got<br />To be young to be dumb enough <br />Trust me I would love to love again <br />But I fucking hate the consequence <br />I’ve been burned, I’ve been hurt too much <br />Always fall, never call the bluff<br />Trust me I would love to love again <br />But I fucking hate the consequence<br />I hate the consequence<br />I hate the consequence<br />I’d love to love again but I<br />I fucking hate the consequence{% endraw %}
