To mark the occasion of Japonismes 2018, a light-up event took place on the Eiffel Tower adorned with the colours of Japan by two world-renowned lighting designers, Motoko Ishii and Akari-Lisa Ishii. The show used Panasonic high-brightness PT-RZ21K laser projectors as part of the spectacular display. Take a look behind the scenes to see how it was done.
