Specific suggestions for improving hygiene. Barbara Lester, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, describes strategies for helping autism spectrum children and teens develop good hygiene routines. Suggestions include a laminated checklist, use of two baskets so that the child moves the items (such as toothbrush and hairbrush) from one basket to another as they use them, and the early development of good routines that will work for the individual into adulthood. These same strategies can be a support for children or teens with other kinds of special needs or executive functioning deficits.<br /><br />For these and some related ideas, also see a blog post of Barbara's on hygiene at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/KXzhH.">http://goo.gl/KXzhH.</a><br /><br />For additional tips, please subscribe to this channel!
