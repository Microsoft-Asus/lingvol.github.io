The three were later shot dead inside the compound.<br /><br />Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that following consultations with security officials the site would be reopened Sunday afternoon with increased security measures that included metal detectors at the entrance gates and additional security cameras.<br /><br />At midday, Israeli police opened two of the gates to the compound to allow worshippers to enter through the newly erected detectors. Police said some worshippers refused to go through them and knelt to pray outside instead. But despite concerns that the new measures could slow movement and spark renewed tensions, police said they appeared to be working fine and that 200 people had already passed through.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe Us - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83scu3zsFxsGpjFJo4f_ug">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83scu3zsFxsGpjFJo4f_ug</a><br />Watch again - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLdP4O03UH0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLdP4O03UH0</a><br />Watch other Videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GiX3UGg3rc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GiX3UGg3rc</a><br /><br />Related Searches<br />Israel<br />Temple Mount<br />Dome of the Rock<br />Al Aqsa<br />Jerusalem holy sites<br />Islamic leaders<br />Israeli-Palestinian conflict<br />Palestinian conflict{% endraw %}
