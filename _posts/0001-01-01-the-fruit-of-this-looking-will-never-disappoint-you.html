{% raw %}Satsang of the Week — 23 December 2018<br /><br />Moojibaba begins this Satsang by asking us if we have found the happiness that doesn’t change, the peace which is so vast it leaves room even for negative emotions to have their play.<br /><br />To find this peace, we have to turn our perspective around—we know the objects of perception but what about the subject?<br /><br />“Is it worth our attention to look at that? Are you an object in front of the lens of perception, or behind the lens of perception?<br /><br />Don’t give me an answer—you must be the answer.”<br /><br />-<br /><br />New videos will be posted weekly on Sundays at 10am Lisbon time on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week.">https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week.</a> On the page you will see the country flags that indicate the available translations for that week.<br /><br />An excerpt from the Satsang, Master Pointing to True Freedom<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/freemedia/master-pointing-to-true-freedom/">https://mooji.tv/freemedia/master-pointing-to-true-freedom/</a><br /><br />6 May 2018<br /><br />This and many other videos can be viewed on Mooji.TV:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/moojitv">http://bit.ly/moojitv</a><br />and<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/sahaja-express">http://bit.ly/sahaja-express</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
