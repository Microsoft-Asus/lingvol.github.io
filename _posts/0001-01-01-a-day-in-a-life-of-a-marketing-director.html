Welcome to our VLOG! We’re The Innate Life; creators of all natural and non-toxic beauty products. We’re a small business with BIG dreams and we want to invite you on our journey. We want to show you what it's really like building a business from the ground-up - the good and the bad.<br /><br />In this video, we take you through a day in a life of Avalon, our marketing director. Avalon starts her day very early at about 6:15 AM for her long commute to work. Her day is filled with meetings, working on The Innate Life's branding materials, website, newsletters etc. <br /><br />We will be releasing a vlog-style video every Saturday on this channel so make sure you SUBSCRIBE to be notified every time we post a VLOG and we’ll see you next time! <br /><br />▽ CHECK US OUT ▽<br /><br />♥ Our main channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIMD...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIMD...</a><br />♥ Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theinnatelife.co">https://www.theinnatelife.co</a><br />♥ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theinnatelife/">https://www.instagram.com/theinnatelife/</a><br />♥ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theinnatelife">https://www.facebook.com/theinnatelife</a><br /><br />▽ STALK US ▽<br /><br />♥ Bhavna: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bhavnak05/">https://www.instagram.com/bhavnak05/</a><br />♥ Avalon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/avalonmohns/">https://www.instagram.com/avalonmohns/</a>
