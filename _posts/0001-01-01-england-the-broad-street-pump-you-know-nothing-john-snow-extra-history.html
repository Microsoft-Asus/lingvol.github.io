As a young man, he treated many patients during the cholera epidemic that struck Newcastle. He noticed that the traditional explanation for cholera's spread - miasma from graveyards and swamps - could not explain its appearance in Newcastle where he treated patients. He took that knowledge with him to London, where he formally studied medicine and achieved the highest honors in his profession in only a year. His formal study of anesthesia earned him such great recognition that on two occasions he was trusted to work on the Queen. But then cholera broke out in London again. Snow wanted to prove miasma didn't cause it and find the real cause, so he interviewed patients and doctors across the city. He theorized that the diarrhea which came from cholera also helped to spread it. He even wrote up a case study where one street whose well water mixed with sewage had a huge infection rate while across the street their neighbors with pure well water barely suffered at all. Confident that he had found the cause, he published his findings, but the medical community was not thoroughly convinced.<br />____________<br /><br />Get the intro music here!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7">http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7</a><br />   *Music by Demetori: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1AaJG4H">http://bit.ly/1AaJG4H</a><br /><br />Get the outro music here!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1iYzuEx">http://bit.ly/1iYzuEx</a><br />   *Music by Sean and Dean Kiner: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LBy9zh">http://bit.ly/1LBy9zh</a><br />__________<br /><br />Extra History - Warring States Japan: Sengoku Jidai<br />Battle of Okehazama: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1IUpYw2">http://bit.ly/1IUpYw2</a><br /><br />Extra Credits - What Type of Player are You?<br />Bartle's Taxonomy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LSrtIx">http://bit.ly/1LSrtIx</a>
