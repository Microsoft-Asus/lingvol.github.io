Many hatchbacks, minivans, MPVs, SUVs or station wagons have this kind of rear door. In its &quot;up&quot; orientation, the door serves as structural support for the CARSULE. <br /><br />The CARSULE's frame consists of two metal spring loops that run along the outline of the side panels. These loops are connected to each other by four aluminum rods. The structure gets its stability from being anchored to the vehicle's rear door with an adjustable anchor strap. Diagonal ceiling tension lines prevent shear deformation while doubling as a means to hang accessories from the ceiling, such as a lamp or cooling fan. The CARSULE is fitted with attachment points for guy lines that can be used for added stability.<br /><br />The adaptive seal is designed so that the CARSULE can latch onto a wide variety of car models.{% endraw %}
