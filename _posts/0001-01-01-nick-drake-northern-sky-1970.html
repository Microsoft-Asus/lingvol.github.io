NORTHERN SKY<br />I never felt magic crazy as this<br />I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea<br />I never held emotion in the palm of my hand<br />Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree<br />But now you're here<br />Brighten my northern sky.<br />I've been a long time that I'm waiting<br />Been a long that I'm blown<br />I've been a long time that I've wandered<br />Through the people I have known<br />Oh, if you would and you could<br />Straighten my new mind's eye.<br />Would you love me for my money<br />Would you love me for my head<br />Would you love me through the winter<br />Would you love me 'til I'm dead<br />Oh, if you would and you could<br />Come blow your horn on high.<br />I never felt magic crazy as this<br />I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea<br />I never held emotion in the palm of my hand<br />Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree<br />But now you're here<br />Brighten my northern sky.
