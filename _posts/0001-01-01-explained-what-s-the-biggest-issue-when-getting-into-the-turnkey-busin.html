In this episode, Robert talks to Antoine Martel about the hurdles in a turnkey business.<br /><br />Robert Leonard:<br />What do you wish you knew about the turnkey business before you got started with it?<br /><br />Antoine Martel:<br />The financing is probably the biggest issue for the turnkey side. For our clients, it’s super easy. If you have a W-2 job or 1099, you have a good credit score, you can go and buy these properties all day long. It’s easy. Once you are, you know, buying these houses that are in livable condition, you renovating them, and sometimes you’re spending and you’re buying a house for 25 grand and you’re spending $30,000 on the renovation.

So now if you have two points or a minimum of $25,000 in points or fees that you have to pay to a bank to just get the loan approved, well, there goes 30% of my profit. You know like, out the window just for getting the loan. And now it becomes very challenging to get these things financed for me to go and buy them which is why we’ve been referring to and going to private money lenders instead, it’s just the best route for us to take.<br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to Real Estate Investing podcast show here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.chtbl.com/REI">https://link.chtbl.com/REI</a><br /><br />To access our show notes, courses or forums, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com">https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com</a><br /><br />⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INVESTING RESOURCES:<br /><br />Ask the Investors: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F8msJn1pD3z95KuFLQWPuf-">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F8msJn1pD3z95KuFLQWPuf-</a><br /><br />Asset Allocation Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F9coxc1aExB8xbw9daFDF6P">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F9coxc1aExB8xbw9daFDF6P</a><br /><br />Real Estate Investing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F_p00VYv3psJ8rhDAGOvR5W">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F_p00VYv3psJ8rhDAGOvR5W</a><br /><br />Millennial Investing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F-NVcnR47rMkT0ByTWQBvBf">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xlkwLDH1F-NVcnR47rMkT0ByTWQBvBf</a><br /><br />⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤ ⏤<br /><br />Download Stig &amp; Preston's 1-page checklist for finding great stock picks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/form-youtube-checklist/">https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/form-youtube-checklist/</a><br /><br />Have a question?
