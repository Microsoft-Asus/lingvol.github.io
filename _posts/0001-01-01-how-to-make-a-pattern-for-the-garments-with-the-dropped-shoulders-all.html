I’m going to show you how to make a pattern for a simple top with the chest darts, the waist tucks and the dropped shoulders.<br />You can change the neckline however you want. Make a round or a square one instead of the V-neck.<br />You can make a seam on the center front and make a button stand in it.<br />You can attach a circle or a half-circle skirt here and make a dress instead.<br />You can make a pleated or a flared dress. <br />You do not necessarily have to make the waist tucks. <br />This base allows you sewing a lot of different garments, just like the pattern for sewing dresses with dolman sleeves.<br />This pattern is perfect for sewing different light clothes. Garments made on its basis are very convenient.<br />These are the needed measurements: the bust, the waist, the hips, the width of the back, the length of the back, the bust height.<br />The techniques for taking the measurements in this case are very simple. They are different from the ones we use when making basic patterns on the basis of my 10-measurement cutting system. The course on the 10-measurement cutting system will be available very soon!<br />I’m going to show you the most simple design. You can change it however you want – add flounces, collars, make dresses instead of the blouses.<br />Be different and beautiful.<br />My name is Paukshte Irina.<br />Subscribe to my channel, write comments, share videos, press the “like” and the “bell” buttons.<br />Thank you!
