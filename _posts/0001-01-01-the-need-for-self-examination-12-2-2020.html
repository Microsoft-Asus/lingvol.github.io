Ask yourself, where am I?  This requires an examination of your life.  The Scriptures encourage us to examine ourselves.  In these times, there are many who are offended and there are many that will deceive.  Jesus is a lot closer to coming back then many realize.  We have to examine ourselves.<br /><br />Here are three rhetorical questions:<br /><br />1.  Am I too comfortable?  Is it possible that our commitment to convenience and that which is familiar greater than our commitment to God?  Luke 12:16-21  We have to ask ourselves, are we rich in the things of God or are we comfortable with the things of the world?  If God called us home this evening would we be confident in knowing that we have served our purpose in life?  Are you too comfortable?  Does the light of God shine through you in your community?  Are you salt, an influencer or are you going along with the status quo?  Can God rearrange your schedule?<br /><br />2.  Am I willing to be embarrassed for God?  Are you willing to be or do what He needs you to do or be?  Are you willing be called names on behalf of God?  Just because you may have a failure in the past, will it stop you from becoming a witness of God?  Are you willing to endure the whispers?  Are you willing the endure the rejection?<br /><br />3.  Will God ask me to do something that believe I am not good at knowing there are others who are better than me?  There are always others who are better, but will YOU do it? (Example: Exodus 4)  Do you know what God has placed within you?  It is more than you know.  God has put something in your facial expression, how you speak, walk and all manner of your existence,  who you are?  God knows exactly what He has placed within you.  He will only bring a Goliath in your path because He knows that He has placed a David within you to slay it.<br /><br />Avail yourself and be willing.  <br /><br />Messenger: Wayne Jones<br />Scriptures: Proverbs 16:2; Isaiah 5:21; Gen 3:9; I Corinthians 28:29<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Services:<br />- Wednesday Evening at 7:00 PM for an Hour Of Power<br />- Saturday Morning at 8:00 AM for Prayer<br />- Sunday Morning at 10:00 AM Worship Experience<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />BUILDING A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY<br />Please sow a seed into Crossroad Christian Church:<br />- At crossroadlife.com<br />- By mail or drop off:  <br />             Crossroad Christian Church<br />             4867 North Dupont Hwy. <br />             Dover, DE 19901 <br />            (No cash please.
