Think 'War of the Roses' seen through the lens of the Coen Brothers. It's got plenty of eye-candy, decent laughs, and bags of style. We love it.<br /><br />Synopsis:  Successful divorce lawyer Miles Massey has everything in life - he's invincible. Enter Marilyn Rexroth, who destroys him in court, leaving him bereft and wondering what to do next.<br /><br />Director:  Joel Coen<br /><br />Starring:  George Clooney, Catherine Jones, Billy Thornton, Cedric, Geoffrey Rush, Richard Jenkins<br /><br />Released:  2003<br /><br />Duration:  104 minutes<br /><br />It's comic gold as two of Hollywood's most dazzling stars - George Clooney and Academy Award-winner Catherine Zeta-Jones - light up the screen in Intolerable Cruelty, a hilarious romantic comedy about men, women, and everything that can go wrong between them. Sparks fly when brilliant divorce attorney Miles Massey (Clooney) meets his match in the beautiful but ruthless Marylin Rexroth (Zeta-Jones).<br /><br />From Academy Award-winning directors Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (Fargo; O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Intolerable Cruelty also stars multi-talented Billy Bob Thornton and outrageous Cedric The Entertainer.
