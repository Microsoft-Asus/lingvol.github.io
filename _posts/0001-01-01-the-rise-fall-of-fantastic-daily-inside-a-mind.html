Fantastic Daily was a top 10 YouTube channel giving a daily dose of paranormal videos found online. The problem though... Everything mentioned within his videos were completely fabricated by himself.<br /><br />To make matters worse, he decided to tell a story of monsters haunting his family. But once the community watching found out what he was doing... It went downhill fast!<br /><br />Today I share an interview I had with Fantastic Daily telling us how he got into the YouTube space and how it all collapsed rather quickly.<br /><br />Support Me On Patreon!<br /><br />(Link on my &quot;About&quot; page.)<br /><br /><br />Social Media:<br /><br />Discord (Link on &quot;About&quot; page)<br /><br />Thank you all for watching!<br /><br />Stay Safe!!<br /><br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br />Written &amp; Edited By Jamie C.
