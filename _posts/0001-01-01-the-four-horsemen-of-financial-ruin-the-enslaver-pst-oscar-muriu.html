The borrower is as slave to the lender, you see the 2nd horseman is called the enslaver and he brings financial ruin by driving you into debt. He has three chains or 3 handcuffs that he binds you up with. The 1st one is called the credit card debt. The 2nd chain of bondage is called consumer debt, the 3rd chain is called the golden handcuffs.<br /><br />As long as you have debt you are a slave to money and it will mess up your service to God big time. You are freest to serve God when he alone is your master and money does not master you, so commit yourself to live a debt free life now, let me say this all debt is bad, there is nothing like good debt, sometimes it is necessary to take in debt...
