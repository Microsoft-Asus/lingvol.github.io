YAY!!! It's that time of year again - CHRISTMAS AT THE CHATEAU has begun! Happy Advent!<br />Here is the third video in our daily Advent Calendar series. Each day will bring a different surprise - you'll have to watch the videos to find out! But you can expect a mixture of exuberant decorations, seasonal florals, delicious food, gift ideas, musical treats and even a little Christmas carpentry...<br /><br />***To see more of the stunning robes or to buy one to luxuriate in yourself, please go to***: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onehundredstars.co.uk/collections/gowns">https://onehundredstars.co.uk/collections/gowns</a><br /><br />***To download this year's Lalande wrapping paper designs, based on my father's medieval paintings, the link to the shop is***:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sellfy.com/chateau-de-lalande-download/">https://sellfy.com/chateau-de-lalande-download/</a><br />They are available at €5 per image, or €10 for four colours.<br /><br />I had hoped to have the papers printed in order to sell them ready-made, but with all of the Covid postal delays that's proved impossible. I had mine printed by Zazzle, and scaled the pattern up online so that I have both regular and large scale versions here for Christmas. You're all welcome to do the same in order to have large rolls made, or to simply print them on your home printers for very small parcels! But please only use them for private (not commercial) use.<br /><br />To see last year's 2019 Day 3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kLRMwlw10eQ">https://youtu.be/kLRMwlw10eQ</a>
