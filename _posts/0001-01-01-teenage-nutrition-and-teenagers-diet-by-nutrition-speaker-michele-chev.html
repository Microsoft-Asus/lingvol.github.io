This is the case following the great presentation you gave to the Queenwood students and parents. I use the word 'lecture' loosely since you never seemed to be lecturing the girls; rather you managed to present what can often be a rather dry, scientific topic with lightness, humour and logic -- all at level which the students could relate to. I think everyone was amazed how quickly 70 mins passed!&quot; Richard Tier -- Sydney NSW <br /><br />Contact Michele at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.AHealthyView.com.au">http://www.AHealthyView.com.au</a> for more information or to book Michele for her Nutrition Presentation to your school.<br /><br />A Healthy View = A Healthy You <br /><br />Nothing tastes as good as being healthy feels!<br /><br />Video by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.remektek.com.au">http://www.remektek.com.au</a>
