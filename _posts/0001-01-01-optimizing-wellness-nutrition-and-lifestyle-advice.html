What’s the right diet for you? More importantly, what’s going to motivate you to follow it? Dr. Gardner will share the keys to acting on the latest nutrition advice, explore the benefits of different food patterns, and debunk healthy-eating myths. He’ll also be recruiting participants for “WELL for Life,” Stanford’s new scientific crowdsourcing effort to improve lifestyle behaviors and health. Presentation by: Christopher Gardner, PhD Professor of Medicine, Director of Nutrition Studies, Stanford Prevention Research Center
