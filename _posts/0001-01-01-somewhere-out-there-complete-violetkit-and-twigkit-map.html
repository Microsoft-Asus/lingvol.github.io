{% raw %}THIS MAP CONTAINS  VERY MINOR SPOILERS FOR &quot;WARRIORS: A VISION OF SHADOWS&quot;!<br /><br />ITS DONE AND ITS PERFECT! This MAP turned out better than I could have hoped with so many wonderful animators taking part. <br /><br />Im honored to have had some many talented people express their interest in this MAP and I even got to discover new animators I hadnt seen before! I wish you could have all join, I really do. <br /><br />This MAP is based on Twigkit and Violetkit from &quot;A Vision of Shadows&quot;, in the early stages of their relationship, just after being seperated and put into differant clans. The sisters are two of my favorite warriors characters and are both endearing and heartbreaking to read about.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this MAP project as much as I do.<br /><br />Animators in order of appearance:<br /><br />meow 286 <br />Flareonnn<br />FelineSeraphim<br />Faded Kat <br />Mitziepie18 and JeanCrafter 1 <br />purrimb <br />TennelleFlowers<br />Allysha Pawpen<br />doritodemon <br />GEKKOZILLA <br />XxUkarixX  <br />Sagutoyas <br />Faye Scribbles<br />Heatherly<br />Blowber JalenR11 Twins for a change <br />Speedienth <br />Kitty-Winder 74<br />EpikBecky <br /><br /><br />NOTE TO THE ANIMATORS:<br />Thank you all so much, you did an amazing job. Every single part is wonderful and Im so happy with the work you have done. You may notice that some parts have been edited slightly (Eg, changed colours, zooms in, ect.)  This isnt because of anything you have done wrong, its simply to help the parts flow into each other a bit nicer. I hope thats okay ;w;<br /><br /><br />SONGS:<br /><br />&quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; Cover By Kaitlyn Maher<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAHtEQWsnJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAHtEQWsnJI</a><br /><br />&quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; Piano Cover By 7# JMPD<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmMUKtHNR1M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmMUKtHNR1M</a><br /><br /><br />Characters belong to Erin Hunter.<br />This is a fan based project.<br /><br />____<br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
