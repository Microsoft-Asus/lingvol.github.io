Learn how to reflect points and a figure over a line of symmetry.  Sometimes the line of symmetry will be a random line or it can be represented by the x or y axis.  Either way when reflecting a point and or figure over the line of symmetry it is important to think of flipping the figure over the line of symmetry to the other side.  The new image is like a mirror of the other side just configured differently.  I often will use the example of a door hinge to represent the transformation of a reflection
