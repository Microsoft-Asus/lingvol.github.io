You can see a video of me speaking Spanish here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/4RVY0O">https://goo.gl/4RVY0O</a><br />- Which camera do you use?<br />I use the Canon 60D with a 50mm lens (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/T2T045)">https://goo.gl/T2T045)</a><br />- Which microphone do you use?<br />I use the SONY ECMCS3 - Very affordable and great value for money:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/uzuIBh">https://goo.gl/uzuIBh</a> (Note that you will need this mic adapter if you want to use it with your iphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/oNtEhN)">https://goo.gl/oNtEhN)</a><br />I also use the Blue Yeti in vintage white for my voiceover work:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/DKTIOR">https://goo.gl/DKTIOR</a><br />- What shade of lipstick are you wearing?<br />I wear Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Sheer Lip Tint in Berry.

Some of it is also based in London which I like.<br />- Can you recommend a British TV Series for me to watch and improve my British English pronunciation?<br />Absolutely! I highly recommend 'Broadchurch' (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/5qdWbJ)">https://goo.gl/5qdWbJ)</a> which is a FANTASTIC crime drama based in a small village in the South of England. The actors are brilliant and it has won lots of awards!<br /><br /><br />p.s if you are still reading this, comment 'I'm writing all the things I ought to do before I die. It's my oughtobiography.'
