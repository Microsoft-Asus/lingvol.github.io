Thinking about buying a boat? Watch this video to see the survey process. Buying a boat is a nerve racking experience so make sure to get the right surveyor involved when it comes to that time! Hope this video helps! <br /><br />If you want to sell your boat in the Florida Keys or South Florida I may be able to help! Contact me at nstanczyk@rkhyacht.com and I may be able to help as the listing agent. Or if you are looking to buy a boat and want a buyers agent I am available for that too. <br /><br />Contact Bill Potter for marine surveying at 305 989 9100<br /><br />Book a fishing charter (or jump on the email waiting list) with Capt.
