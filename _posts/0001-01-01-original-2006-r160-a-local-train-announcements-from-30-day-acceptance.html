A special upload taking you back to 2005/2006 when the R160s are brand new, here are the original automated announcements from the 30 day acceptance testing on the A line , Bound for Far Rockaway Mott Avenue. <br /> As a bonus i also added the weekday / weekend / night / rush hour transfers at the appropriate stops. You can tell there has been a lot of changes done to this program when comparing it to the 2019 counterpart here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjozEXUzAw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjozEXUzAw</a><br /><br />From Inwood - 207 Street in Manhattan to Far Rockaway - Mott Avenue in Queens via Central Park west Local / 8 Avenue Local / Fulton Street Local. <br /><br /><br />Original transfers recorded between August and October of 2006 during the revenue acceptance testing and merged with higher quality audio that was recorded at various times from 2014 to 2019.
