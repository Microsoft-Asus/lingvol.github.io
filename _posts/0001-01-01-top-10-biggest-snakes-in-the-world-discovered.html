Floridian Python<br />Burmese pythons are in theory native to Southeast Asia. However, they also do extremely well in Florida, so now we all have to beware of the Giant Python Invasion!! Not that long ago, the Everglades were teeming with raccoons, opossums, marsh rabbits, and other small critters invading trash cans and every now and again spotted as roadkill.<br /><br />9. Black Mamba<br />Venomous snakes are usually a lot smaller than constrictors, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt grow to relatively enormous sizes. The black mamba is one of the most dangerous and fastest snakes in the world slithering at speeds of up to 13 mph. They are found across southern and eastern Africa. <br /><br />8. Medusa<br />Medusa holds the world record for being the longest snake to ever be kept in captivity, and she was gigantic. Measuring 25 feet and 2 inches long (7.67 meters), and weighing 350 pounds(158.8 kg), it required 15 people to hold her up at full length so she could be measured to qualify for the record.<br /> <br />7. Malaysian Python<br />In 2016, workers on a construction site on the island of Penang in Malaysia spotted something moving beneath a fallen tree. They went to take a closer look, and to their amazement found that it was an enormous reticulated python.<br /><br />6. Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake<br />Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnakes are native to the southeastern US, and are one of the heaviest venomous snakes on the continent and easily the largest type of rattlesnake. Locals have long known to be careful around them because of their long fangs and potent venom, but sometimes you can‚Äôt avoid them if they‚Äôve strayed into town, or into your home!.<br /><br />5. King Cobra<br />King Cobras are the longest venomous snakes in the world! They are also probably the world's most famous species of venomous snake because of their recognizable hoods, and they have played an important part in local Indian and Southeastern Asian cultures for thousands of years. <br /><br />4. Brazilian Anaconda<br />Anacondas can be found across South America, and are the largest known snake species on earth. They grow to such sizes because they rely on their muscular bodies to wrap around and squeeze the life out of their prey, and there's no creature in the rainforest that's safe from them. <br /><br />3. Laophis Crotaloides<br />The first fossils of the extinct Laophis crotaloides were found in 1857, but after those specimens were lost it would be more than 150 years until more were found, and the truth behind this prehistoric monster was uncovered.<br /><br />2. Green Anaconda<br />The green anaconda is the world‚Äôs largest snake by its sheer weight. Measuring between 20-30 feet and weighing between 200-550 pounds, this snake is the longest and heaviest snake around today! They can be found in the freshwater streams, ponds, marshes, and swamps of the Amazon. <br /><br />1. Titanoboa<br />The Titanoboa was the largest snake, that we know of, to have ever lived. At more than 48 feet long, and with a weight in excess of one and a half tons, it was an absolute monster. They lived around 60 million years ago across South America, and potentially beyond, and we know of it because of a remarkably well preserved fossil that was discovered in an open pit coal mine in Colombia.<br /><br />#biggest #snakes #world
