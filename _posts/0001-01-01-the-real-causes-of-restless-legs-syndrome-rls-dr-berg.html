There are 2 main causes, one is a vitamin B1 deficiency due to lactic acidosis, and the second cause being a potassium deficiency. Dr. Berg then talks about insulin resistance and how this alone will keep your potassium from being absorbed. So the cause may be dietary but it may be an insulin problem. The other problem is stomach acid - if you do not have the acid in your stomach, you will not be able to absorb potassium from that alone.<br />Potassium Citrate is a good remedy.<br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, 55 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
