About 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth was anything but suitable for life. The average temperature was well over 3,000°F – much hotter than even lava. You couldn’t live there, and breathing was certainly out of the question. Those continuous volcanic eruptions released toxic gases into the sky. Our Earth had almost no atmosphere.<br /><br />But then life found a way. The planet cooled and hardened. Water appeared. Oceans formed. The atmosphere became breathable. Complex life appeared and began evolving. And the rest, as they say, is history. Now imagine that atmosphere – the very thing we breathe, our warm blanket, the planet’s protective bubble! – was gone in the blink of an eye! But not for long, just 5 quick seconds! Surely we can handle it, right?<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />1 second with no atmosphere 1:40<br />2 seconds 3:28<br />3 seconds 5:07<br />4 seconds 6:43<br />5 seconds 7:10<br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
