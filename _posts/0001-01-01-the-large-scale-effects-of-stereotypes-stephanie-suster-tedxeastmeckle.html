Why are blondes perceived as dumb? Why are all Asians perceived to love math? In a personal and surprising talk, Stephanie Suster discusses the large negative effects of stereotypes and what we can do together to break past them. <br /><br />Stephanie Suster was born in Caracas, Venezuela and moved to the US in 2001. She has lived in Boston, Dallas, and Puerto Rico before moving to Charlotte, NC. She is an avid fan of oldies music (particularly Billy Joel and Elton John). Stephanie also loves to read, write, and play soccer.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
