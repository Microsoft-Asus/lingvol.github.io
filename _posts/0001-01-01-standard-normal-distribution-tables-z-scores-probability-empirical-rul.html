This statistics video tutorial provides a basic introduction into standard normal distributions.  It explains how to find the Z-score given a value of x as well as the mean and standard deviation.  It explains how to determine the probability by finding the area under the curve represented by f(x) - the probability density function using the empirical rule and the Z-tables.  This video contains plenty of examples and practice problems.<br /><br />Here is a list of topics:<br />0:00 - Introduction into standard normal distributions<br />6:55 - How To Find The Z-scores Given x<br />8:37 - How To Calculate x Given The Z Score<br />10:33 - Calculating Probability Using The Empirical Rule<br />20:24 - How To Use Z-Scores To Determine The Area Under The Curve<br />22:44 - How To Use Standard Normal Distribution Z-Tables<br />24:31 - How To Solve Probability Problems Using Z-Tables<br />34:15 - How To Find The 90th Percentile<br />42:43 - How To Calculate The Mean and Standard Deviation of a Random Sample<br /><br />My Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.video-tutor.net">https://www.video-tutor.net</a><br />Patreon Donations:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br />Amazon Store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/theorganicchemistrytutor">https://www.amazon.com/shop/theorganicchemistrytutor</a><br /><br />Subscribe:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA?sub_confirmation=1</a>
