Restriction mapping requires the use of restriction enzymes. In molecular biology, restriction maps are used as a reference to engineer plasmids or other relatively short pieces of DNA, and sometimes for longer genomic DNA<br /><br />In this video, you will understand how to create restriction maps of a circular DNA{% endraw %}
