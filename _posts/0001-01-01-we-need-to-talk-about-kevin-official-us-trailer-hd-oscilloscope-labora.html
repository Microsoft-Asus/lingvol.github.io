{% raw %}NOW AVAILABLE ON DEMAND AND DIGITAL - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ow.ly/eFXGu">http://ow.ly/eFXGu</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.oscilloscope.net/kevin/">http://www.oscilloscope.net/kevin/</a><br /><br />A suspenseful and gripping psychological thriller, Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN explores the factious relationship between a mother and her son. Tilda Swinton, in a bracing, tour-de-force performance, plays the mother, Eva, as she contends for 15 years with the increasing malevolence of her first-born child, Kevin (Ezra Miller).<br />Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN explores nature vs. nurture on a whole new level as Eva's own culpability is measured against Kevin's innate evilness. Ramsay's masterful storytelling simultaneously combines a provocative moral ambiguity with a satisfying and compelling narrative, which builds to a chilling, unforgettable climax.{% endraw %}
