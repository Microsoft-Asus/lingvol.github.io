{% raw %}There's just something about them... Join <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.WatchMojo.com">http://www.WatchMojo.com</a> as we count down our picks for the top 10 most interesting men in the world. For this list, we're taking inspiration from the Dos Equis most interesting man in the world, and are looking at modern, living renaissance men, who march to the beat of their own drum and are hella successful in everything they do.  There's also a cool factor we can't quite place...  In recent years, Russian president Vladimir Putin earned a reputation as THE most interesting man in the world.  And, between his shirtless pics, athletic prowess and the random videos of him singing, we kinda agreed.  But the recent anti-homosexuality crusade he's sent Russia on now just makes him controversial.  <br /><br />If you want to suggest an idea for a WatchMojo video, check out our new interactive Suggestion Tool at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.WatchMojo.com/suggest">http://www.WatchMojo.com/suggest</a> :)<br /><br />Check us out at Twitter.com/WatchMojo and Facebook.com/WatchMojo <br /><br />We have T-Shirts!
