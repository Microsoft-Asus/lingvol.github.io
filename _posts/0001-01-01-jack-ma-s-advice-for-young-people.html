Nothing is free. <br />If you want to be successful, you have to pay the price. <br />Alibaba 18 years to today's size, <br />yeah we are lucky, but we work much harder! Than most of the people! <br />We never sleep well and sound in the evening. <br />I traveled last year 867 hours a year, in the plane. <br />I'm working hard, my team is working very hard. <br />18 years we work like normal company 70 years. <br />Day and night. Nothing is free. Nothing is easy. <br />You have to think different, you have to do different. <br />Early days in my company, when some ideas come to my desk, <br />&quot;Jack this a great idea!&quot; and I look at everybody, <br />everybody say it is a good idea, I normally threw it into the rubbish. <br />Because everybody says it is good. <br />Then all the other people thinking, if everybody says this is gonna be very tough, <br />I'm very interested in that tough question and I pick up and say, <br />&quot;How can we do it in a different way?&quot; <br />This is to be unique, to be different. <br />And the third, this is my advice and this is also, I'm telling myself every day. <br />Today is very tough, tomorrow is tougher, the day after tomorrow is beautiful, <br />but most people die tomorrow evening. <br />You have to work very hard, every tough day, every tough situation, <br />problems you meet, that is the training of yourself. <br />When you graduate in your school, you just started your career of learning. <br />When you got a PhD diploma, a bachelor diploma, <br />this is just a certificate your parents paid the tuition. For 4 years. <br />Your real challenge is when you leave the college, the real life starts, <br />the real exam starts, the real test starts. That's life! <br />So, one thing you are lucky as I said, if students cannot survive, <br />99.9% of people in the world cannot survive. <br />Only you have this confidence, you will be able to face the challenge of future. <br />If you have 20-30 years, please find a good boss, not necessarily a good company, <br />learn from the boss, learn how to do it. <br />When you're 30-40 years old, try to do something yourself, if you really wanna try. <br />When you're 40-50 years old, do things that you are good at, <br />after 20 years of learning you should do something you're good at. <br />When you're 50-60 years old, spend your time supporting young people. <br />When you are over 60 years old, spend time with your grandchildren. <br />That is normally a lot of people like that. <br />So when you are a graduate or when you're just in the university, don't think about, <br />&quot;I want resign from the school and be another Bill Gates, because Bill Gates left Harvard.&quot;<br />There's only one Bill Gates in the world. When you graduate find a company, <br />most important find a good boss, that can train you, discipline you. <br />Tell you what is good and right. It's more important than a good company. <br />Of course, a good company, a good boss even better. <br />And then, continue your life. It's all about a partner.<br /><br />Additional Tags: <br />jack ma, jack ma advice, jack ma advice for young, jack ma advice on career, jack ma alibaba, jack ma career advice, jack ma career path, jack ma interview, jack ma interview english, jack ma motivation, jack ma speech, jack ma's advice for students, motivational speech, motivational video
