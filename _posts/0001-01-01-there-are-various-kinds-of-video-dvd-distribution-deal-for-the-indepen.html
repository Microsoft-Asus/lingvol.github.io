WRITE A TREATMENT (Part 5)... &quot;Write &amp; CYA...WGA $20&quot;<br />(For all Film Producer Tips go Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Filmbay/">https://www.facebook.com/Filmbay/</a> ... Click &quot;LIKE&quot; &amp; Share page<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Hollywood lives off of Treatments and Scripts; Ideas are a dime-a-dozen and you believe you have a Great Idea...so to bring it into the system and hopefully make money while practicing your Oscar® acceptance speech, you must take your Idea, that has no value, but might be Great, and make it into a tangible form that you can likely protect... And that tangible for is called a Treatment.<br /><br />Write a 3-5 Page Treatment...So get 3-5 pieces of 8.5 x 11 blank paper.<br /><br />PAGE-1 is ACT I: Double spaced typing. Allocate the Top Half of Page 1 and type the 5 &quot;Ws &amp; H&quot; (Who, What, Where, When, Why &amp; How). And each time, in the treatment that you introduce a NEW CHARACTER type his/her name in all UPPER CASE Letters, then give his/her age and a 7-15 word visualization of the person.<br /><br />Then, as the story continues in Act I, Act II &amp; Act III each time you type the character again, if you do, just use Upper &amp; Lower case letters.<br /><br />PAGE-2+ (Half of Page-1) &amp; (Half of Page-3) is ACT II: Know the Roller Coaster Ride (5 UH-OHS, 5 OH-SHITS &amp; 1 OH-MY-GOD) that your primary story (you're A-Story) takes and use these 11 Scenes as one paragraph each of prose typing and, again, each time you introduce a new character, all UPPER CASE Letters, Age &amp; description... This will probably, space wise, entail the Bottom-Half of Page-1, all of Page-2, and the Top-Half of Page-3.<br /><br />PAGE-3 is ACT III: Type how your movie ends with you're a-Story coming to a conclusion as the 3 Sub-Plots (B-Stories) resolve themselves and, in so doing, become intertwined into the A-Story and pushes the A-Story to resolve itself.<br /><br />COVER PAGE: Centered, 6 lines down, type the (A) TITLE. Skip a line and centered type (B), within parenthesis, &quot;A Treatment for Feature Film&quot;. Then skip a line and centered (C) type the small case word &quot;by&quot;. Then skip a line and (D) type &quot;your name&quot;. Finally, in the bottom left hand corner, single space typing in all capital letters (E) type &quot;CONTACT DETAILS and then type (F) ADDRESS, PHONE &amp; E-Mail... Don't hide.<br /><br />TREATMENT: 3-5 Pages, with a proper cover page, a Beginning, a Middle &amp; an End, with 5-7 fleshed out characters and a solid Roller Coaster A-Story with a skeleton structure of 11 Scenes.<br /><br />REGISTER: Yes! Why? Because you can't copyright a Treatment, however, you still need proof-of-creation, that has merit in our court system, on the specific day you created this thing. And, the Writers Guild of America states that a Treatment IS A FINISHED PRODUCT and will gladly accept your $20 (non-members) and $10 (members) and give you a receipt that verifies the Date They Received It.<br /><br />POORMAN COPYRIGHT: Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. WHY? Because it has absolutely no merit in the court system. Don't do it. Don't do it. In another post (Hot Tip) I'll tell you why the Poorman's Copyright is useless.<br /><br />Happy Filmmaking, The Filmbay Team,<br />Filmbay.com<br />**************************<br />*Produce *Finance *Write *Direct *Distribute *Profit<br /><br />--------- Click &quot;LIKE&quot; &amp; &quot;SHARE&quot; -------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Filmbay">https://www.facebook.com/Filmbay</a><br /><br />--------- For more Filmmaking, Film Tips &amp; News FOLLOW US on Twitter&quot; -------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FILMBAY_CINEMA">https://twitter.com/FILMBAY_CINEMA</a>
