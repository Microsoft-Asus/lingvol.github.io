France held a scaled-down annual Bastille Day celebration on Tuesday, with none of the usual tanks and troops parading down Paris's Champs-Élysées avenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic still lingering in Europe. Instead, President Emmanuel Macron, standing in the back of a military jeep, reviewed ranks of socially-distanced troops in the Place de la Concorde square after a flypast by military aircraft.<br /><br />Health workers who have been in the front lines of France's battle against the virus also joined troops on the square for the ceremony, garnering applause from attendees.<br /><br />It is the first time since 1980 that the annual parade has not been held along the Champs-Élysées. The fireworks will go ahead this year, but the parkland around the tower will be closed to the public.<br /><br />Bastille Day, or the French National Day, dates back to the 1789 revolution.
