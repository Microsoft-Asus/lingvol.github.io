Mombasa county government has transformed a 19-bed capacity private wing at the Coast Provincial General Hospital into an Isolation Unit for Coronavirus cases.<br />Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho says the county has also trained 24 county health personnel to handle any coronavirus case.<br />However at the Likoni Channel, the county emergency response team is yet to provide hand washing services as agreed on Saturday and residents who use the ferry want the Kenya ferry services and the county government of Mombasa to speed up the process.
