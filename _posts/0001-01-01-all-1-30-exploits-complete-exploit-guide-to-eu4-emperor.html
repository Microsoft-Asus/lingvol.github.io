In this EU4 1.30 Exploit guide, I showcase all (I think) of the major EU4 exploits that you can do before loading into the game in the 1444 start date. We gain free cores, create custom ideas, enable the synthetics in ironman, create ghost nations, unlock the three mountains and world conquest, and much much more. EU4 Patch 1.30 has still has all of the major exploits we know *and love?* so make sure to have some fun. I doubt these will last forever.  I also give a few teasers as to the next Europa Universalis 4 video that I will be releasing.
