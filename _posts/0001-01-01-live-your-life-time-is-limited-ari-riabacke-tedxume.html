I have studied decision making nearly half of my life; I have worked hard to be able to make well-deliberated and rational choices in all sorts of situations in life and business – and to help others to do so too. So, therefore, I must admit, it was a sorrowful moment when I one day realized that many of us are so obsessed by making the best decisions that we fail to make the most important ones. Most of us have never even reflected on what they really are. I will talk about what life has taught me, the gap between science and reality, and about how we in our ambition to be super-rational and to avoid taking risks often end up taking the greatest risk of them all – not living the life we truly wish to live.<br /><br />PhD in Risk and Decision Analysis, has worked as a risk and decision expert at Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) when the decision was made about where to store the nuclear fuel in Sweden the next 100,000 years. Prior to that, he was Head of Business Intelligence at the largest Swedish management and IT consulting company. Today, Ari works as a consultant, researcher, speaker and advisor. He is a member of the Decide Research Group at Stockholm University and is a columnist at CFO World. He has redrawn the decision making maps of thousands of people and numerous companies, and helped people to make life changing decisions.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
