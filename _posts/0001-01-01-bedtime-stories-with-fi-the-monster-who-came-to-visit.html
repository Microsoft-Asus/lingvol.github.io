Story Time! Are you snuggled down and ready to listen to a story before bed? I hope so!<br /><br />Tonight, I am reading a book called The Monster Who Came to Visit by Neesa Bally and Nooshin Behyan. <br /><br />The author asked me to read this for you so I hope you enjoy it... In this rhyming story a little girl's attempts to befriend a monster lead from one disaster to the next. All is not lost though as this unlikely pair may have more in common than you think.<br /><br />If you'd like to find out more about this author then please follow this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.neesabally.com/">https://www.neesabally.com/</a>
