The world today is heavily reliant on China to manufacture almost everything we take for granted in our modern lives. <br /><br />Report’s of companies desperately looking for supply chain alternatives and speculation about countries that are going to move in to take their place have been all over the news, and perhaps there is some merit to this speculation, but a lot of this may be un-grounded in genuine economics and rather just be the product of things people want to be true. <br /><br />▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀<br /><br />📚 Want to learn more about the economy of China?
