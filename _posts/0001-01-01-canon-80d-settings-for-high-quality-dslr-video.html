Learn how to setup a Canon 80D for video. See all the gear used below and at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thepodcastersstudio.com/gear.">http://thepodcastersstudio.com/gear.</a><br /><br />You'll want to make sure you start by switching your 80D into video mode and set your dial to &quot;manual.&quot; This will give you complete control over all your settings and prevent the camera from changing anything while filming. It's very important to remember that in manual mode you must adjust your settings such as aperture, ISO and shutter speed based on the lighting in your environment. Learn the exposure triangle and how each setting affects the other so that you can make the proper adjustments for whatever scene you are shooting. <br /><br />The very few video menu items that I skip do not affect the quality of your video and you are free to set them however you like for your shooting style. In other words, you don't need to worry about the setting if I didn't cover it;)<br /><br />The menu items you see in this video are in order of appearance starting with the very first menu (Shoot 1) when you're in video mode and I walkthrough each item that is a video setting after that.<br /><br />Next you want to make sure you set the white balance for your lighting environment. There are preset settings for inside, outside and other but I prefer to use the K (kelvin) to manually dial in your color temperature. One trick can be to use auto white balance to see what the camera says the WB should be, then go over to K, match the setting and leave it there until you change lighting again. This is an important step to get right because you are working with a compressed image and it's harder to correct in post production than getting it right in the camera.<br /><br />Set your Movie Recording quality. Your best option is 1080p 24fps (23.98) .mov. But if you want to shoot slow motion or fast moving subjects (sports), switch to 1080p 60fps mp4. <br /><br />Whichever frames per second you choose (24, 30, or 60), set your shutter speed to double your frame rate. So in the case of 24 fps, set your shutter speed to 1/50. Use you ISO and aperture in combination to get the best exposure for your scene and leave the fps and shutter speed the same for all clips. <br /><br />If you're recording audio into the camera, use manual settings to adjust your gain properly for the microphone you are using. I like to stay under the first quarter mark on the settings in order to maintain the cleanest audio but this will depend on the microphone you are using.  <br /><br />Music licensed from premiumbeat.com: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1BJbspm">http://bit.ly/1BJbspm</a><br />Track: “Dubday” by Cymatix<br /><br />*Gear used to make this video:<br /><br />Canon 80D DSLR camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/80DbodyBH">http://podhelp.me/80DbodyBH</a><br />Sennheiser ew100 G2 Wireless Lapel Microphone <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/Sennkit">http://podhelp.me/Sennkit</a> <br />Linco Flora Easy Softbox kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/1floraeasykit">http://podhelp.me/1floraeasykit</a><br />Transcend SD card 16 and 32GB Class 10 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XWn4mD">https://amzn.to/2XWn4mD</a><br />Canon 28mm F2.8 IS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/Canon28mmf28ISBH">http://podhelp.me/Canon28mmf28ISBH</a><br />Sigma 30mm 1.4 ART (new, better version, mine is DQ'd) B&amp;H: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/S30mm1-4ArtAmazon">http://podhelp.me/S30mm1-4ArtAmazon</a><br />Manfrotto 701 HDV Tripod <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/701hdv055xbkit">http://podhelp.me/701hdv055xbkit</a> <br />Manfrotto 394 Quick Release Plate and Base <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://podhelp.me/394plate">http://podhelp.me/394plate</a> <br /><br />&quot;Ray's Way&quot; picture profile:<br />Setup a custom profile and start with either Standard or Neutral (see which you like best) and then adjust the following settings.<br />Sharpness: 1<br />Contrast: first mark from left (or negative 3)<br />Saturation: first mark from left (or negative 3)<br />Color Tone 0<br /><br />See an image of this setup: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/podcasthelper/photos/a.194414313907870.56646.142934445722524/1370879832927973/?type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/podcasthelper/photos/a.194414313907870.56646.142934445722524/1370879832927973/?type=3&amp;theater</a><br /><br /><br />*all links should be considered affiliate links.
