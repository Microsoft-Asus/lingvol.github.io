{% raw %}► Today we are looking at some interesting and rare historical photos from the past, third volume.<br /><br />In focus today: &quot;Wait For Me Daddy&quot;, 1940<br />This is a famous historical picture, better known as &quot;Wait for Me, Daddy&quot;, taken in October 1st, 1940, in Canada.<br /><br />Canadian photographer, Claude Dettloff, was getting ready to take the picture of the whole column of the British Columbia Regiment, marching down the hill in New Westminster. They were being deployed and families were about to be separated by the War. A five-year-old, Warren &quot;Whitey&quot; Bernard, suddenly ran out of his mother's grasp to his father, Private Jack Bernard, for the last goodbye. And history was made when the photographer snapped the shot. <br /><br />The mother's outstretched hand and the swirl of her coat, the boy's shock of white hair and his own reaching hand, the father's turning smile and the downward thrust of his own outreaching hand, the long line of marching men in the background, all this makes an unforgettable image, a masterpiece of unplanned composition, a heart-grabbing moment, frozen for all time. The picture was quickly picked up all over the world, getting exposure in LIFE magazine and it hung in every school in British Columbia during the war.<br /><br />Jack Bernard survived the war and came back home, after 5 years, in October 1945.<br /><br />&quot;The day Dad came home, my grandfather picked me up and took me to the station. That was probably the happiest day in my 10-year-old life&quot;, Warren said in an interview.<br /><br />On October 4th, 2014, the city of New Westminster unveiled a bronze statue honouring the photo. At the unveiling of the statue, everyone was overwhelmed by the emotion this photograph evokes. One of the veterans present said, “It’s not about war, and blood and guts, and guns. It’s about the families that get left behind.”<br /><br />The picture that Dettloff captured, is considered to be one of Canada's most famous war images.<br /><br />Check video for more interesting and rare historical photos...<br />---------<br />If you have enjoyed the video, please show some love by LIKING, COMMENTING and SUBSCRIBING to my channel!<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />#MysteryScoop #RareHistoricalPhotos #InterestingHistoricalPhotos<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />For any Copyright issues, please reach out to us first before filing a claim with YouTube.
