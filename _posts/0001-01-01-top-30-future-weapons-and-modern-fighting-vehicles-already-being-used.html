{% raw %}Join us on the battlefield as we take a trip across the globe to find the biggest, brightest and best weaponry and military hardware from recent years, as well as predictions of the future. <br />Hypersonic Missiles<br />Since the 1990s, the American Air Force Research Laboratory has been involved in the design, development and testing of a hypersonic propulsion system with a view to creating a missile capable of Mach 6 (4,000mph). The result is the Boeing X-51 Waverider, an unmanned scramjet aircraft designed to be launched from a B-52 bomber or F-35 fighter. Still a work in progress, the X-51 Waverider has shown plenty of promise during testing reaching speeds of over 3,000 mph. <br />Armatix Smart Pistol<br />The Armatix Smart Pistol is a .22 calibre pistol with smart technology designed to ensure it can only be fired by an authorised user. Unlike designs from the movies, this gun doesn't function by a fingerprint reader on the grip, but instead requires the use of an accompanying smartwatch. This watch operates as a RFID key to the lock allowing it to fire. The watch itself also holds other real-time data on the gun including battery charge levels and the number of shots fired within a given timeframe. <br />Fostech Origin 12 shotgun<br />The Fostech Origin 12 shotgun is pitched as the World's fastest firing shotgun. Although not fully-automatic, this shotgun is capable of firing 30 rounds in under eight seconds. It's also capable of working with a SilencerCo Salvo 12 sound suppressor, making it a menacing weapon in anyone's hands. <br />ADAPTIV camouflage <br />The enemy can't shoot what they can't see. That's the goal of BAE Systems ADAPTIV camouflage; to mask a military vehicle's infrared signature and shield them from detection by allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. This technology essentially renders thermal imaging systems obsolete and ensures friendly fighting vehicles are offered some protection from initial detection.  <br />CV90120-T Ghost<br />The Swedish T Ghost is a camouflaged tank that uses BAE's ADAPTIV camouflage to make it invisible to enemy thermal imaging systems. The Ghost tank also uses a high-calibre 120mm compact main cannon with new technology designed to reduce recoil and lower overall vehicle weight. <br />MAgneto Hydrodynamic Explosive Munition (MAHEM) <br />The MAHEM weapons system by DARPA uses a magnetic flux generator to fire a projectile without the traditional use of chemical explosives creating a more efficient and precise launch system. This projectile weapons system also uses molten metal to penetrate enemy armoured vehicles increasing lethality and effectiveness on the battlefield. <br />TASER Shockwave<br />The TASER Shockwave is a large-scale area denial system designed to help assist with riot control situations. Essentially a large modular system for firing numerous TASER X26 stun guns in a 20-degree arc with a 25-foot range. Not something you'd want to be anywhere near when it went off. <br />Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System (MAARS)<br />Black Knight Combat Vehicle<br />Precision-Guided Firearms<br />Laser Weapon System (LaWS)<br />Laser Avenger<br />Human Load Carrier (HULC)<br />Personnel Halting And Stimulation Response (PHASR)<br />Electromagnetic Rail Gun<br />High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD)<br />Hybrid Insect Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (HI MEMS)<br />XM25 Counter Defeliade Target Engagement (CDTE)<br />Active Denial System (ADS)<br />Cornershot<br />ADS Underwater gun<br />KRISS Vector<br />Zumwalt Class Destroyers  <br />Northrop Grumman MQ-8C Fire Scout<br />Extreme ACcuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO)<br />Obrum Stealth Tank<br />Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD)<br />Quantum Stealth camouflage<br />Among this which one seems most terrible to you let us know in the comment section. <br />#UltimateFact #Facts #2020 #Top #Ultimate #Top10 #Fact #Top5{% endraw %}
