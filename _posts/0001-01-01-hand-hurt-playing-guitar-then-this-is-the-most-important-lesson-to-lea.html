Two of the most important lessons I ever learned about playing the guitar were how to hold it, and how helpful good posture is. And they're actually pretty easy. Interestingly enough though, I didn't learn that information from my teachers (I've had four of them). I think I was just expected to figure it out for myself. <br /><br />I finally got the hint after I'd been playing for about 15 years and started developing terrible wrist and forearm pain. After working with a physical therapist and taking several months to relearn how to play, I can say that I've been problem free for more than 15 years since (yep, I've been playing for about 30 years). <br /><br />So here's a quick overview of how to hold the guitar and why good posture is important as well. These are the same tips I give to my students to help them avoid the same problems I did. If you're experiencing anything like this now, or expect to play the guitar for many years to come, you NEED to watch this lesson. <br /><br /><br /><br />Most Important Guitar Lesson | Guitar Lessons | Basic Guitar Lessons | Easy Guitar Lessons | Playing Guitar | Guitar Technique | Hand Hurts Playing the Guitar |
