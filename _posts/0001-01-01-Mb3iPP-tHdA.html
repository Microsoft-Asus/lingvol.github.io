Higher quality original is here; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQuvfTE8Ro">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQuvfTE8Ro</a><br />This is an original 16mm Scopitone conversion, not a copy. I used an actual old scopitone player, fed the signal to an old VHS, of which I then fed the output to a Canopus ADVC300. This 'summer of love' 1967 hit record was remuxed in 2006. Also fixed audio-sync.<br />Sound engineer of this famous mono mix was Keith Grant. Vocals and piano played by Gary Brooker. Matthew Fisher played the Hammond organ, and these original lyrics were written by Keith Reid;<br /><br />We skipped the light fandango<br />turned cartwheels 'cross the floor<br />I was feeling kinda' seasick<br />the crowd called out for more<br />the room was humming harder<br />as the ceiling flew away<br />when we called out for another drink<br />the waiter brought a tray<br /><br />and so it was that later<br />as a mirror told its tale<br />that her face at first just ghostly<br />turned a whiter shade of pale<br /><br />She said: &quot;There is no reason<br />and the truth is plain to see&quot;<br />but I wandered through my playing cards<br />would not let her be<br />one of sixteen vestal virgins<br />who were leaving for the coast<br />and although my eyes were open<br />they might just as well've been closed<br /><br />and so it was that later<br />as the miller told his tale<br />that her face at first just ghostly<br />turned a whiter shade of pale..<br /><br />This composition stands tall on its own. Every song out there is *inspired* by those from other songwriters, you don't need to brag about your miracle discovery. So please stop commenting about it being 'originally written by' Johann Sebastian Bach?<br /><br />Also see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf73XwjZIFQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf73XwjZIFQ</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_trOp2HGUAM?t=223">https://youtu.be/_trOp2HGUAM?t=223</a><br /><br />Much gratitude goes to Gary, Matthew and the Keiths for having the heart to let me keep this ad-free, non-monetized, scopitone-conversion on YouTube!
