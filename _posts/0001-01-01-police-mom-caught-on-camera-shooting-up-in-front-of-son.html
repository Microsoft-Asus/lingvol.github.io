{% raw %}CINCINNATI (WKRC) - A woman was caught on camera shooting up drugs with a man she'd just met as her three-year-old son watched, police said Thursday.<br /><br />Lauren Story was taken into custody at a bus stop in front of the Hamilton Co. Courthouse Thursday morning. Police said her son was dirty and hungry but otherwise fine. He was turned over to Hamilton Co. Job and Family Services. Story denied using drugs in front of her son.<br /><br />John Donaldson's camera captured the incident. He said he saw the incident as it happened in Glanker Alley which connects Vine and Hamer Sts.<br /><br />&quot;It was right about here,&quot; Donaldson said as he pointed the area. &quot;They were sitting in front of the box, sitting right next to the box just, the parents were here and the kid was leaning against the wall.&quot;<br /><br />Donaldson called police to help the boy but the had left by the time police arrived. Police started circulating a photo from Donaldson's video in the hope of finding the child.<br /><br />&quot;He was just well-behaved and sitting there watching it. He was leaning against the wall and it's really just a sad sight,&quot; Donaldson said.<br /><br />Donaldson has set up a neighborhood watch around Grant playground on McMicken Ave. The group has hidden cameras in the neighborhood.<br /><br />People buying and using drugs in Over-the-Rhine has been a problem for years. Some people in the neighborhood call one spot off of McMicken &quot;crack alley.&quot; Lakisha Williams said she used to sell drugs but has turned her life around and tries to help others.<br /><br />&quot;I think it's horrible because there's kids down here and there's a playground right there so it's not a good thing,&quot; Williams said.<br /><br />Some people in the neighborhood said they were happy that something was being done to send a message that selling and using drugs won't be tolerated.<br /><br />&quot;People appreciate the effort and are getting involved. It's going to take time but I think the message is getting out,&quot; Donaldson said.<br /><br />Lauren Story was charged with possession of drug abuse instruments and felony child endangering. Police said she was charged with a felony because Story had been charged with child endangering in the past after driving under the influence with her daughter in the car.<br /><br />Story is scheduled to appear in court Friday morning. She remains in the Hamilton Co. Justice Center.<br /><br />Police responded to several overdose calls in District 1 Wednesday night which includes Over-the-Rhine. Two officers became sick after coming into contact with drugs. They were taken to the hospital for observation but later released.{% endraw %}
