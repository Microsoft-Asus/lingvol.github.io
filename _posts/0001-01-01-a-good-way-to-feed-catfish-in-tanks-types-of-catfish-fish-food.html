{% raw %}A Good Way to Feed Catfish in Tanks : <br />In catfish farming or any other type of fish farming feeding is one of the most important things. There are many things to be considered if you want the catfish to grow well and thriving.<br />Feeding frequency : <br />Just like how the feed size matters in feeding the fish you should also pay attention to how often you feed them. Different stages of growth require a different frequency of feeding too.  Fingerlings of 3-4 grams weight should be fed twice per day.  When they reach the post fingerlings and juvenile stage you can keep feeding them twice a day or reduce it to once a day.  Next after they reach the post juvenile or above that you can reduce the feeding frequency to once a day.<br />Types of Catfish Feed : What do catfish eat is a common question to ask for a beginner in fish farming.  Basically you can get any type of catfish feed on any fish store around your area.  Some bigger store even has organic fish food that is good for your fish’s growth.  Give your catfish an adequate amount of protein to keep them growing well.  Aside from different sizes, there are also floating feed and sinking feed.  The floating feed is those that keep floating after you spread them in water while the sinking feed is those that immediately sink after you throw them into the water.  The floating one is good for the smaller size of fishes like the fingerlings or the juveniles stage.  While the sinking one is better for bigger fish as they are naturally bottom feeders.<br />#feeding_frequency #catfish_feed #floating_feed<br />Welcome to &quot;MY CLICK SUPPORT&quot;.
