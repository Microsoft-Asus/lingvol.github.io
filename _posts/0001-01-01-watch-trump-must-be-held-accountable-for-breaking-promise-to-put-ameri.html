Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said at the impeachment trial for President Donald Trump on Jan. 24 that the president must be held accountable for “breaking his promise to the American people.”Jeffries then played a clip of Trump saying he will put the interests of the American people first. “America is an idea, a precious idea. An idea that’s withstood the test of time,” Jeffries said. “We can either defend that idea or we can abandon it. God help us all if we choose to abandon it.” After spending two days laying out the case for the first article of impeachment — abuse of power — House Democrats spent the better part of Friday making the case for the second article of impeachment — obstruction of Congress. The House of Representatives impeached the president in December. The Senate trial will determine whether Trump is acquitted, or convicted of the two articles of impeachment and removed from office.<br /><br />For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-who-in-the-trump-impeachment-inquiry">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-who-in-the-trump-impeachment-inquiry</a><br /><br />Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG">https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG</a><br />Find more from PBS NewsHour at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour">https://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6">https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6</a><br /><br />Follow us:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour">http://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/newshour">http://www.twitter.com/newshour</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/newshour">http://www.instagram.com/newshour</a><br />Snapchat: @pbsnews<br /><br />Subscribe:<br />PBS NewsHour podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts</a><br />Newsletters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe</a>
