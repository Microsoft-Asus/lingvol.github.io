A 33-minute practice to ground physically and energetically. In this session, we will focus on using the power of breath and movement to create equilibrium from the inside out. This practice is ideal if you have been feeling off-center, or out of a routine that feels supportive. A perfect jumpstart to your day‚Ä¶ or to your year. The hardest part is showing up. Take 33 minutes to go on a little journey to ROOT to RISE again. I will meet you there. <br /><br />Let me know how this practice goes for you in the comment section down below! <br /><br />For more videos like this, try: <br />Grounding into Gratitude - Root Chakra Yoga: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0pbuvhbg7po">https://youtu.be/0pbuvhbg7po</a><br />Revolution Day 25 - Root Practice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Jff16ltluLA">https://youtu.be/Jff16ltluLA</a><br />Anchor in Hope Yoga Practice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RoSO3_0Ufr0">https://youtu.be/RoSO3_0Ufr0</a><br />Meditation for Mental Balance and Grounding: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x0nZ1ZLephQ">https://youtu.be/x0nZ1ZLephQ</a><br /><br />Suggested Playlist: Yoga for Grounding: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzzPFzFh9X0_mXLqznJBqW_F">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzzPFzFh9X0_mXLqznJBqW_F</a> <br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBecome a FWFG YOGA member! üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fwfg.com">https://fwfg.com</a><br />Join Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
