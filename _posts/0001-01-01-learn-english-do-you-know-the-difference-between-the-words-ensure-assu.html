In today's 'Learn English' video, we continue our series on homonyms by discussing three words that sound similar but mean different things. These words are ensure, assure and insure. <br /><br />We explain all three words with examples and images so that you can figure out the difference between them and use them correctly. <br /><br />Knowing the difference between confusing words will also help you in the Verbal/English sections of tests like CAT, GMAT, GRE, SSC-CGL, BANK PO, SAT, ACT etc.<br /><br />‚è© Watch other important confusing words and their meanings + usage:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib8claqLffn0o2H4Sf93Ri564vQniu-l">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib8claqLffn0o2H4Sf93Ri564vQniu-l</a><br /><br />___________________________________________<br /><br />Subscribe üëÜ  to Learning with Friends and press the bell icon üîî so that you never miss a video.<br /><br />Follow us on Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/cerebraledutech">https://www.facebook.com/cerebraledutech</a><br /><br />-- closed captions included --
