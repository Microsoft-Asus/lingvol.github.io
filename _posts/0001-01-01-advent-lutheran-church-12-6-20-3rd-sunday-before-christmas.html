We welcome you to this time of worship together, gathering through time and space by the God who is not bound by time or space.  You are invited to create a worship space that helps make your worship setting &quot;holy&quot; (set apart). You might have a bible, and light a candle. <br /><br />JOIN US for this Third Sunday Before Christmas, live at 8:30 am on December 6, 2020, and available for viewing any time afterwards. Share this link with others. And contact our church office - office@adventharleysville.org - to comment on this worship service or connect with our community.
