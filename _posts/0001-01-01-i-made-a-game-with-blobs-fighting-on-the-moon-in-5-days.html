A third person blob shooter game where you play as BOB THE BLOB and shoot your way through waves of enemy blobs as you explore the moons of the Orion Nebula. To defeat the blobs, we must shoot nets at the in space! <br /><br />In Moon Blob, you have a starting amount of health and energy that you can use to defeat the waves of blobs, once you reach 0 health you lose. There is no additional health or power-ups so your survival ability will be all that you can take with your on your journey.<br /><br />Legend has it, no one has seen the BLACK MOON and lived to tell the tale. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy this video where I showcase how I built Moon Blob for the Github Game Off 2020 Game Jam! The game lasted from November 1st to December 1st, but as I only learned about the jam on Thanksgiving day, I only had 5 days to complete the game! I think the game turned out very well and I hope you enjoy the comedic video of me building it while trying to ward off the waves to Blobs! <br /><br />Enjoy! =)<br /><br />-- Music, check out these amazing Artists! -- <br />►&quot;Mystical Pixels&quot; By TeknoAXE (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHcwd_tBVDM)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHcwd_tBVDM)</a> <br />►&quot;New Challenger&quot; By HeatleyBros (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlQaSqIvkFc)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlQaSqIvkFc)</a><br />►&quot;Absolute Zero&quot; By MDK (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TKgbiqoVyM)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TKgbiqoVyM)</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/MDKOfficialYT)">http://www.youtube.com/MDKOfficialYT)</a> (Free Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://morgandavidking.com/free-downloads/)">https://morgandavidking.com/free-downloads/)</a><br />►&quot;Hero's Heart&quot; By HeatleyBros (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4tTGLfOG7c)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4tTGLfOG7c)</a><br />►&quot;8 Bit Summer!&quot; By HeatleyBros (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TiE9Vvmlxew)">https://youtu.be/TiE9Vvmlxew)</a><br />► &quot;8 Bit World&quot; By HeatleyBros (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VijZQa6hT9U)">https://youtu.be/VijZQa6hT9U)</a><br /><br />Make sure to check out the HeatlyBros Channel!
