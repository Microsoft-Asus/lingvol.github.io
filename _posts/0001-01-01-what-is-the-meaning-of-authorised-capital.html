{% raw %}The maximum number of shares a private limited company can issue is decided by its #authorised capital. Most start-ups start their journey with the minimum #authorisedcapital of Rs. 1 lakh, but this is too little as the #business grows. To issue new shares or raise the capital a company is authorised to raise, the capital clause of the Memorandum of Association needs to be amended by passing a special resolution of the board. If, at this point, you may also need shares to be issued to existing promoters or new shareholders.<br /><br />Get this service online @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vakilsearch.com/advice/authorised-capital-paid-up-capital/">https://vakilsearch.com/advice/authorised-capital-paid-up-capital/</a><br /><br />For more updates: <br />Subscribe us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/legalsolutionsvakil/">https://www.youtube.com/user/legalsolutionsvakil/</a><br />Like us at : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/vakilsearch">https://www.facebook.com/vakilsearch</a><br />Follow Us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Letsvakilsearch">https://twitter.com/Letsvakilsearch</a><br /><br />What is this authorized capital? What does the term even mean? <br /><br />The answer to that question is authorized capital is referred to as the value of shares, not the amount of money you invest. It is equal to the value of the shares. So when people think about a company they feel that the value of the shares is equal to the value of the investment in the company. That is not true. <br /><br />Example 1:<br /><br /><br />So, for instance, if you look at a company like Tata Motors or Reliance. They have one lakh shareholders; each share is worth say five hundred rupees. So the value of the shares in the company is equal to 500 into one lakh. That is the value of one share into the value of the number of shares of the company. On the other hand, the amount of investment in the company may be much more than that. So when you talk about authorized capital, the authorized capital is only the value of the shares in the company. Coming to a small company or entrepreneur with a startup.<br /><br />Example 2:<br /><br /><br />Let's think about a large chocolate cake as the shares of the company. So authorized capital is that large chocolate cake which represents the entire shareholding of the entire shares of the company. <br /><br />You can divide that chocolate cake into several smaller bits and then give it out to different people. So authorized capital represents the maximum chocolate cake which you can give to other people. You can always increase the authorized capital by baking more cake. That's allowed. But on day one when you start if you have an authorized capital of one lakh it means the value of the shares in the company on day one is one lakh.<br /><br /> It does not mean that you have one lakh in cash. It also does not mean that you're invested only one lakh in the business you would have invested a lot more in the business. So on day one when you start the business that chocolate cake which you have is worth one lakh rupees, you're valuing it at one lakh rupees and you can give up one lakh worth of shares to a lot of people. At the cost of reputation since this is a very commonly asked question. It does not mean that you need to have one lakh in cash or assets. It also does not mean that you need to invest one lakh in the business. You can invest a lot more or you can invest a lot less.<br /> So if you have any further questions do log onto vakilsearch.com or contact one of our customer service executives.
