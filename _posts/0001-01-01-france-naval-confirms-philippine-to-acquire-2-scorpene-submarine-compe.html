Amongst the well advanced programs in Brazil, India and Australia, he talked about the selection process in the Netherlands. But according to Naval Group’s CEO, it seems that the French company is also very active lately in the Philippines.<br /><br />Another country were we’ve been very active during the global pandemic is the Philippines. The Philippines is looking for submarines to increase their naval capacities and create a new submarine force. We’ve kept in close touch with the Philippines authorities during the crisis. We’ll see in the next weeks if this project moves forward.

The AM2000 is capable of remaining submerged on underwater patrol for three times longer than the CM2000.<br /><br />©️ COPYRIGHT / LICENSING <br />————————————————<br />If any producer/label/artist has an issue with any of the songs or footages please send me an e-mail to (dutchmanf77@gmail.com) and the video will be taken down immediately.{% endraw %}
