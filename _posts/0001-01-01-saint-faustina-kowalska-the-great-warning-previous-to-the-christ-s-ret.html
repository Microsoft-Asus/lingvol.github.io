{% raw %}Saint Faustina Kowalska, The &quot;Great Warning&quot; previous to the Christ's Return, The Parousia and the End Times<br /><br /><br />Second Coming<br />In Christianity, the Second Coming of Christ, the second advent, sometimes called the parousia, is the anticipated return of Jesus to Earth. The Second Coming belief is based on prophecies found in the canonical gospels and in most Christian eschatologies. Christians generally believe the anticipated event is predicted in biblical messianic prophecies. Views about the nature of Jesus' Second Coming vary among Christian denominations and sometimes among individual Christians.<br /> <br />Most English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use include the following beliefs about Jesus: &quot;...he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. ... We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.&quot;{% endraw %}
