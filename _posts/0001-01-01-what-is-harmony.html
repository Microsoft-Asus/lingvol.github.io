{% raw %}Harmony happens in music when two or more pitches are combined.  Combining pitches together can add sophistication and interest to music and there are almost infinite possible combinations to explore!<br /><br />When two notes are brought together to produce harmony, this is called a chord.  Learning about all of the different types and flavours of chord is really important in becoming a good musician.  <br /><br />With a good understanding of harmony we can make a good melody even more effective!<br /><br /> Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.daveconservatoire.org">http://www.daveconservatoire.org</a> to watch hundreds of free video music lessons just like this one and complete interactive exercises to practice your skills!{% endraw %}
