The 1998 classic Practical Magic is the story of two sisters, Sally and Gillian Owens, played by Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, who come from a long line of witches. The film is a staple in the genre of '90s witch classics, and, while many kids have watched the movie, there's a lot in the film that young viewers probably didn't notice. <br /><br />Everyone loves a cool aunt, especially one who will give you a ride to the mall and totally let you bum a cigarette. But Practical Magic made everyone wish they had an Aunt Frances and an Aunt Jet in their lives.<br /><br />They're sassy, their outfits and hair can't be beat, and that margarita night is the epitome of cool aunt vibes. But don't let their positions as resident cool aunts make you forget about another super cool Practical Magic aunt, Gillian. Gillian is Sally's sister, and her daughters' aunt, and she's wild and fun like any cool aunt should be. Sure, she may have been pretty absent from the girls' lives in the beginning, but her good times hanging out and partying by the pool just makes this cool aunt even cooler.<br /><br />Watch the video for more about things about Practical Magic you only notice as an adult!<br /><br />#PracticalMagic #Movies #SandraBullock<br /><br />Calling all cool aunts | 0:21<br />How to get away with murder | 1:14<br />Sorry, Sally | 2:06<br />Girl power | 3:14<br />Bozo with a badge | 4:03<br />Fire burn and plothole bubble | 4:52
