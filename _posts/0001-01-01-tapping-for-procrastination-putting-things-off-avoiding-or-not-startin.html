She is a Level 5 certified Master in FasterEFT and one of the highest trained practitioners in the entire Southern Hemisphere. She was the first to introduce FasterEFT to Australia, personally inviting the founder of FasterEFT to the country to present his training. <br /><br />Pam has given countless presentations to groups and organisations, both in person and online. She has also been invited on numerous occasions to share her expertise on radio. Pam has conducted thousands of hours of personal consulting, run numerous workshops using EFT and FasterEFT and has presented on everything from learning to love yourself to creating prosperity. <br /><br />Before discovering FasterEFT and tapping, Pam found herself stuck in the corner of a room, rocking and wanting to die. She had been earlier diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and had a number of negative references, memories, beliefs and emotions, not to mention a long and complicated family history of mental illness, to support this diagnosis. She was ready to give up on life! <br /><br />Then, following a personal breakthrough during a therapy session, she discovered tapping. The path to recovery was instantly made very clear. Now, Pam is an empowered woman and 100% committed to her happiness. She is also living symptom free, without the need for medications. <br /><br />Pam’s genius is assisting people to understand how they are creating their current challenges and then helping them to release and eliminate these problems from their lives. <br /><br />Read Pam's new memoir, Why Am I So Screwed Up and access the free online companion program here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pamwright.com.au/resources/">https://pamwright.com.au/resources/</a> <br /><br />Grab your copy of Pam’s book, The FasterEFT Beginner’s Handbook: Simple Steps to Stress Less and Smile More here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pamwright.com.au/resources/">https://pamwright.com.au/resources/</a> <br /><br />Attend Pam’s next Happiness Seekers Online event: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pamwright.com.au/events/">https://pamwright.com.au/events/</a> <br /><br />CONNECT WITH PAM: <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pamwright.com.au">http://pamwright.com.au</a> https://<br />Facebook: www.facebook.com/FasterEFT.PamWright/
