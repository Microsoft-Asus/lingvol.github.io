Hart found his greatest fame as the silent screen's most popular cowboy. His 1914 &quot;The Bargain,&quot; directed by Reginald Barker, was Hart's first film and made him a star. The second Hart Western to be named to the National Film Registry, the film was selected because of Hart's charisma, the film's authenticity and realistic portrayal of the Western genre and the star's good/bad man role as an outlaw attempting to go straight. Named to the National Film Registry in 2010.
