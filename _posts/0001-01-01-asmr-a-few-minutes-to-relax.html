A gentle relaxation ASMR for those busy days. I'm still a beginner with this, but I really enjoyed making it. Making the video was a great pause for reflection for me, I hope it works for others.<br /><br />I’m really keen to make more relaxation videos, it’s right in the edge of my comfort zone to do, but I’m looking forward to learning.<br /><br />It's also my first time using 2 mics (Behringer XM8500) - hopefully a few more audio tweaks and this will be working well.<br /><br />As I'm having so much fun with this, I'll move to a regular schedule when I'm happy with the format.
