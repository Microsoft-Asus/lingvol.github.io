I'm Evelyn, and I have a grudge against my parents. You see, they have two daughters, my sister and me, yet they love only one of us. And that's, obviously, not me.<br />Mom and dad have long considered me an unlucky child. And that's kinda true. I'm not beautiful by any margin and not even cute. My quick thinking also left much to be desired. For example, neighbours' children were able to talk and recite poetry at the age of three and I was just struggling with simple speech.<br />Guess that wasn't actually my fault. You see, mom and dad worked day and night and I was left with an old nanny who could watch tv for hours without saying a word. Therefore I never had someone to communicate with and was largely left to fend for myself.<br />As you must've already guessed, I wasn't a model student at school. Actually, the teacher told me I was one of the worst pupils in my class. Well, at least I avoided a corrective class so there's at least that.<br />00:00 Evelyn story<br />05:47 Second version
