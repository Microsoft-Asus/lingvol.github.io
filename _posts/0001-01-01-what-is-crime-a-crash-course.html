TRANSCRIPT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://criminologyweb.com/what-is-crime-definition/">https://criminologyweb.com/what-is-crime-definition/</a><br /><br />In this video, I try to answer the question of: what is crime? I discuss how the definition of crime and criminal law changes, and how crime is the product of society, time, and place. The definition of crime is important for psychology and criminology and it can be used as a basis for criminal psychology.<br /><br />If you're interested in more fascinating criminology facts and findings, including the psychology of crime, feel free to check out my blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.criminologyweb.com">https://www.criminologyweb.com</a>
