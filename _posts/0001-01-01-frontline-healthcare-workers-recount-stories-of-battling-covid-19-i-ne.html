With 1 million dead from Covid-19, healthcare professionals around the world share stories from the front lines. From Toronto, Canada to Bangalore, India, workers illuminate the frontline experience treating patients with coronavirus.

Still, the death toll continues to rise. <br /><br />More than 1 million people — likely many more, given inadequate reporting in some regions — have now died from Covid-19. The virus, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, has spread to most countries around the world. Some of the worst outbreaks materialized in both hemispheres, as far afield as Brazil, the U.S., and Italy. <br /><br />Even in wealthier countries with advanced health systems, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, health-care workers are nearly 12 times more likely to test positive for the virus than the general population, studies have shown.<br /><br />Those without adequate access to PPE have the highest risk. CNBC interviewed doctors, nurses and other front-line workers across the world to see how their countries and health systems are grappling with the pandemic. <br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a><br /> <br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
