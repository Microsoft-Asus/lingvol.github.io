Thanks to Eibach for sponsoring today's video!

Why not cheat and get a couple billion year head start in your design process. On todays episode of B2B, we’re going to look at how nature inspires the auto industry to build not more eye pleasing cars, but better engineered ones. We're gonna see how butterflies helped to build a better catalytic converter, how mantis shrimps were studied to build stronger and lighter carbon fiber and how the sailfish helped McLaren go faster.<br /><br />Biomimicry Institue <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://biomimicry.org/">https://biomimicry.org/</a><br /><br />Helicoid Industries <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.helicoidind.com/">https://www.helicoidind.com/</a><br /><br />Metalmark <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.metalmark.xyz/">https://www.metalmark.xyz/</a><br /><br />Frank Stephenson<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0prFtEeFBIRwm57wu2lBpQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0prFtEeFBIRwm57wu2lBpQ</a><br /><br />New to the Channel? <br />►Watch this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFl907chpCa42gkh1oJxuJBN0cZ4YT1HT">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFl907chpCa42gkh1oJxuJBN0cZ4YT1HT</a><br /><br />We upload almost every day, subscribe so you don't miss out!<br />►Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO">http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO</a><br /><br />Click here for more info on joining the Donut Underground!<br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6JmiMXKoXS6bpP1D3bk8g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6JmiMXKoXS6bpP1D3bk8g/join</a><br /><br />Shop Donut Merch: <br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.donut.media/">http://www.donut.media/</a><br /><br />Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.
