{% raw %}The muscles that move the eye within the orbit appear straightforward at first sight, but the ways in which they work together to move the eye can lead to confusion. Let's look at the anatomy!<br /><br />When looking medially, the superior oblique muscle depresses the eyeball/direction of the pupil &amp; the inferior oblique elevates the eyeball. Not what I said at the end of the video. The cranial nerves of the extraocular muscles will describe this more slowly &amp; clearly. I hope. <br /><br /><br />Daily Anatomy App:<br /><br />For a random human anatomy question every day on your phone you can get my Daily Anatomy question app from the Apple App Store:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/daily-anatomy/id1001729137">https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/daily-anatomy/id1001729137</a><br /><br /> or Google Play Store:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suanatomy.dailyanatomy">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suanatomy.dailyanatomy</a><br /><br /><br />Music by Jahzzar<br />Album: Come<br />Song: The Letter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/jahzzar">https://soundcloud.com/jahzzar</a>{% endraw %}
