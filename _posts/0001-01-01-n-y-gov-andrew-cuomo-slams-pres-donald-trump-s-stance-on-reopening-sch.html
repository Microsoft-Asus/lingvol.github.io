New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized President Donald Trump on Wednesday for pressuring state officials to reopen schools this fall.

Andrew Cuomo blasted President Donald Trump on Wednesday for pressuring state officials to reopen schools this fall, saying the federal government doesn’t have any authority over the matter.<br /><br />“School reopenings are a state decision. Period. That is the law, and that is the way we’re going to proceed. It’s not up to the president of the United States,” Cuomo said during a news briefing in Albany. “The president does not have any authority to open schools. We will open the schools if it is safe to open the schools. Everybody wants the schools open.”<br /><br />On Tuesday, Trump — joined by first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence at the White House — said he would pressure states to reopen schools this fall. Although dozens of states are struggling to contain a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, the president called for schools to open in August and September. <br /><br />Trump ramped up his campaign earlier Wednesday, threatening to withhold federal funding from schools that don’t resume in-person classes this fall. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Cuomo said he will announce the state’s decision in August on whether schools will open after thoroughly reviewing public health data and reopening plans from local school districts.<br /><br />The governor said he has been consulting with educators and others on how schools should reopen in September. By July 13, the state hopes to finalize its guidance so that local school districts can submit their reopening plans by the end of the month. Between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7, New York will make an announcement on its decision, Cuomo said.<br /><br />“The test that I bring to all of these things, day camps, overnight camps, is my child test. I am not going to ask anyone to put their child in a situation that I would not put my child in, and that’s how I make these decisions,” he said. “If it’s not safe for my child, it’s not safe for your child. So we’ll get that data, and we’ll make that decision in August.”<br /> <br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a><br /> <br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
