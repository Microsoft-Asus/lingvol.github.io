To celebrate the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landings, here's some previously unseen animated footage. <br /><br />These unbelievable clips were animated from still photographs, using Adobe Photoshop.

Why choose this as our goal? <br /><br />And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why thirty five years ago fly the atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?<br /><br />We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things. Not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to measure and organise the best of our energies and skills. Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept. One we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win, and the others too. <br /><br />We shall send to the moon, two hundred and forty miles away from the control station in Houston. A giant rocket more than three hundred feet tall - the length of this football field. Made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented. Capable of standing heat and stresses, several times more than has ever been experienced. Fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch. Carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communication, food and survival. On an untried mission. To an unknown celestial body. <br /><br />And then return it safely to earth, reentering the atmosphere at speeds of over twenty five thousand miles per hour. Causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun. Almost as hot as it is today. And do all this. And do all this, and do it right. And do it first, before this decade is out. Then we must be bold.
