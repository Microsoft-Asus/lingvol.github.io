**SIMILAR CLASSIC CARS ALWAYS REQUIRED**<br /><br />An exceptionally rare Rover 216SX with an incredible 21,450 miles from new.<br /><br />EQUIPMENT<br />Body coloured bumpers, integral front bib spoiler, body coloured grille and door mirrors, bronze tinted glass, power operated screened glass sunroof, laminated windscreen, styled halogen headlamps, fresh air heater with four speed fan, soft-feel three spoke steering wheel, rake adjustable steering wheel, remote fuel flap and boot release, heated rear window, door operated courtesy lighting, twin-tone horn.  Factory fitted options; Full Tan leather interior, boot lip spoiler, Vitesse alloys wheels.<br /><br />EXTERIOR<br />This incredibly rare survivor is finished in Rover White Diamond (code NMN) and boasts a pure brilliant shine with a uniform finish.  Structurally perfect with all factory panels remaining, this corrosion free example has led a truly cosseted existence throughout its meagre 21,450 miles covered.  All panels gaps are consistent and the bumpers and trims sections are spotless.  A small area of touched in paint around the edge of the petrol flap is barely worthy of mention and certainly pales into insignificance in comparison with the overall impeccable finish.  This Rover Management vehicle still retains the original factory Rover badged number plates.  Now representing a near enough extinct vehicle, this very late Mk1 facelift 200 Series run out model has been preserved in amazing order and is ready to impress classic car show goers!<br /><br />INTERIOR<br />Climb into this light and airy cabin and the unmistakable 1980's Rover smell instantly invokes nostalgia!  The beautifully trimmed interior was factory upgraded to Tan leather (code LMK) having been specified as a Rover Management vehicle, an option that was not even offered to the consumer!  The leather to the seats and matching door coverings is truly exceptional as you would expect from the very low mileage covered with only very faint and minimal crease lines to the outer driver's seat bolsters.  The coloured keyed fascia and incorporated illuminated switchgear is perfect, and all functions and controls operate exactly as intended.  The headlining is clean and intact and the original carpeting is spotless.  A wonderful classic 1980's Rover interior remaining exactly as the manufacturer intended.<br /><br />ENGINE &amp; TRANSMISSION<br />The original four cylinder 12valve transverse mounted OHC engine displaces 1598cc and produces 86bhp at 5600rpm.  The programmed ignition with electronic carburettor control remains fitted and operates faultlessly allowing this beautifully quiet unit to jump to life at the first flick of the key.  The engine delivers eager yet smooth acceleration and the five speed manual transmission is a delight to use and offers both light and exact changes with a comfortable cruising manner.  A characteristically civilised and refined Rover.<br /><br />WHEELS, TYRES &amp; BRAKES<br />A further factory option specified by the Management at Rover is in the form of the four upgraded 'Vitesse' cross spoke alloy wheels.  These items are perfect and are shod in 175/65 R14 tyres with excellent tread remaining.  The original Pirelli P4 tyres are also available with the car and add a brilliant touch of originality.  The servo assisted, diagonally split dual circuit braking system incorporating front discs and rear drums offer steady and assured stopping power.   Fastidious maintenance of all mechanical components is evidenced both in the history file and certainly in the manner this example performs.<br /><br />HISTORY FILE<br />Registered new on the 1st February 1990 by the Rover Group under the Management Car Plan.  This was a programme that enabled Rover Management the privilege of ordering a new company car every six months to their specification and explains the very unique options this vehicle has fitted.   One of the last Mk1 200's produced it was sold to its second owner, Mrs Panton, in October 1990 for Â£7,495.  She remained the vehicles careful custodian 22 years until April 2012 having it annually serviced and MOT'd with all supporting documentation retained confirming the impeccable maintenance and low miles of just 21,450.   Enthusiast owned by two subsequent marque advocates this vehicle offers a wonderful opportunity into unspoilt Rover pleasure.  All handbooks are contained in the brown leather A5 folder, two keys are included and a period brochure.
