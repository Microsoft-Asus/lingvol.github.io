{% raw %}In 1998, assembly began in space on a satellite that would be second in size and radiance only to the Moon…NASA’s International Space Station.  Completed in the 21st Century, the International Space Station’s role in the development of your future as well as that of the United States space program is enormous. Many things learned in space are already benefiting life right here on Earth.  Ultimately this satellite will be the springboard enabling nations around the world to prepare to take the next giant leap past our Moon and into the Solar System. Today NASA and the International Space Station invite you to join us for the first opportunity in history to participate in the academic challenges and commercial opportunities available as NASA travels beyond Earth to understand and explore the Solar System.{% endraw %}
