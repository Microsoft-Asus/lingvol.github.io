Message: The Loyalty of God<br />Scripture: Romans 11:1-5<br />Speaker: Bishop T.D. Jakes<br />Date: Sunday, September 27, 2020<br /><br />God foreknew you. Whatever you're going through, have gone through, and will go through, comes as no shock to Him. He isn't put off by a checkered past. God's loyalty? It knows no bounds. Perfection isn't required to get or keep Him. He'll sit there with you all the while; when you're hurting, in your foolishness, and after you rebel â€” He's not getting up from His seat that's right by your side. Have you been looking for solid ground to stand on? It's the character of our loyal, loving God!<br /><br />American Sign Language: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6YoysLygFVg">https://youtu.be/6YoysLygFVg</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the official T.D.
