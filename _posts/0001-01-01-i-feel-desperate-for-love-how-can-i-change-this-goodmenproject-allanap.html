I am so desperate to find someone that I feel as I am willing to date the first woman that even glances at me. What am I doing? Why am I doing this?<br />Answer: Your instincts are correct great man, to release impatience and drop into authenticity. And yet there's another force in competition to those instincts… let's call it an empty heart who's looking to be filled up from the outside in versus the inside out.<br /><br />While this feels awful for the short term, this is great news as your soul is evolving from a world where worth was only found in achievements and accomplishments… To a world where the internal creates the external and you live as the overflow of confidence, power and freedom from the inside out…<br /><br />Which makes you quite irresistible by the way to a quality woman, while feeling quite alive like a noble bad ass yourself!<br /><br />A technique that I share in my Complimentary Workshop, &quot;Soul Shaking Conscious Relationships&quot; that I will be launching again in December 2017… Is the concept of &quot;Little Me.&quot; Imagine that the part of you that's impatient and desperate is Little You who lives inside the back, darkest, locked-up chamber of your heart. He doesn't like you much because every time he feels desperate you whack him over the head with a 2 x 4 and shove him back in that dark closet without love or food or acknowledgment or understanding or validation or patience or kindness… Make sense?<br /><br />One of the quickest ways to dissolve you're desperate feelings and grow your impatience into confidence, certainty and inner peace… is to start having your most important relationship and be with Little Me instead of the first woman who glances at you.<br /><br />Believe me, initially you probably think this advice really sucks! I'm asking you to be alone with yourself, to sit in the fire, to start loving yourself unconditionally, and dissolve your self judgment. That's a pretty tall order when you're lonely and feeling desperate. I get it.<br /><br />And yet we both know even if you were to start dating the first woman that glanced at you, you'd probably be afraid she leave you, or your eyes would wander to someone else who might be a better catch, or you might give away your power just to make sure she doesn't break up with you, the point is it would NOT be a healthy intimate epic romance that lasts, would it?<br /><br />It takes tremendous humility and courage to be willing to work with me. I ask men to sit in the fire and take two steps inward so they can take 10 steps forward. In a world of quick fix, instant gratification and checking our phones 35 times a minute… sitting with your discomfort without judgment is not a skill many of us have learned to excel at… that's why people find private coaching with me extraordinarily effective because I sit in the fire with you so you can surrender into my tender loving potent arms, and allowed me to heal your heart and bring you home to little me so that the two of you never leave each other again.<br /><br />The results of this INTERNAL union is that you have an EXTERNAL union meeting someone amazing in record time and creating an epic romance that lasts.<br /><br />It's one of the greatest privileges in honors to take someone home to themselves… And the results are they become this magnetic vortex of sacred sexuality and irresistible confidence because they no longer need anybody's approval to be enough! They are a safe space to be authentic and people simply feel better around you because you feel good all the way to your core. Make sense?<br /><br />I have a wonderful inexpensive home study curriculum called &quot;Dear Lover&quot; that you can find at www.GetHerToSayYes.com and as I mentioned before, this December I will be launching my complimentary workshop again so be sure to get on my newsletter list :-)<br /><br />Honestly I think the greatest gift you could give to yourself, your soul, and your successful relationship future is to do a series of Six Sessions with me to heal this desperation to the core so that you can be in a successful relationship as soon as possible, yet in divine time… The patience of eternity creates instant results, yes?<br /><br />You can apply for a complimentary Find Your Perfect Mate Session with me to see if you're a fit to be invited to do this unwavering confidence building work together… By applying at www.allanapratt.com/connect.<br /><br />It is my greatest privilege to LOVE YOU until YOU DO… So that SHE will... in a lasting heart healthy way :-)<br /><br />Great love and blessings, and total honor of you for reaching out…<br /><br />Excited to celebrate you getting a great woman to say YES to magnificent YOU, Allana xox<br />Music by:<br />4 Chambers - written by Aeone / BMI<br />Published by Angleterre Music /BMI
