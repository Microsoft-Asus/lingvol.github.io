&quot;Organic is the only living solution to climate change,&quot; says Vandana Shiva, food and agriculture expert and member of the World Future Council. Nowadays, favouring the scale up of agroecology – which includes producing organic products – is unfortunately not that simple.  the World Future Council (WFC), together with IFOAM-Organics International and FAO, have identified legal frameworks and policies that feature important elements of agroecology. The awarded policies are real examples of best practices that can contribute substantially to scaling up agroecology as a pathway to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
