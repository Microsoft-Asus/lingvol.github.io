This is the first tutorial on how to build a custom web document management system. During this tutorial, I will be covering the architecture of the application as well as how to send requests to an API from the front end (link front end to API). <br /><br />I will be going into further details in future videos but wanted to first introduce a lot of essential topics. Hopefully, you guys found this video informative.<br /><br />Links:<br /><br />API: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/</a><br />Jquery CDN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://code.jquery.com/">https://code.jquery.com/</a><br />phpstorm IDE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/</a>
