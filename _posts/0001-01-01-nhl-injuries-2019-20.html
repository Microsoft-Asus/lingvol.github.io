Hi guys! I'm back with another video and today you'll be looking at some gruesome injuries that occurred during the shortened 2019-20 NHL season. Now there were so many different injuries this year, I just had to add a few of the more known ones. There were e a lot of injuries where there were no clips so if you notice a player who was injured didn't make this video, that's most likely why. Hope you enjoy the video and make sure to like and subscribe if you're new!
