{% raw %}Having successfully navigated the challenges of finding employment in seven countries over the span of 15 years, Laura guides you through her journey and provides tips on how to find success...wherever you are.  Laura E.P. Sheehan - Career Strategist and Founder of E.P. Career Strategies<br />Laura is a U.S. lawyer turned expat career strategist who stumbled upon her life’s calling whilst living in Hanoi.  Having decided years ago to accompany her husband in his international career moves, Laura has lived in seven countries over the span of 15 years. Mere weeks into her time in Hanoi, Laura seized upon a new opportunity to utilize her experiences to empower the wider global community of “trailing spouses.” In the two short years that she has been in Vietnam, she has successfully made a full transition into the role of a global career strategist. Laura was recently recognized by the Associates of the American Foreign Service Worldwide (AAFSW) as a top nominee for the 2017 “Champion of Career Enhancement for Eligible Family Members (CCE-EFM)” Award and was featured in the AAFSW’s January 2018 edition of Global Link. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
