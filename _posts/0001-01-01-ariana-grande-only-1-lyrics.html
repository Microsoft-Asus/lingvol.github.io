{% raw %}Ariana Grande - Only 1 Lyrics<br /><br />I want you, I want you<br />I want you, I want you<br />I want you, I want you<br /><br />Let me introduce myself<br />Let me introduce myself<br />Let me introduce myself<br /><br />Lookin' in your eyes makes me wonder how<br />I got so much time with you and there's more around<br />I know all the competition that's after you<br />So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?<br /><br />That we're living<br />In a fairytale no malice and no lies<br />Baby, oh, it's hard to believe<br />All the love you have inside is only mine<br />That's how I know<br /><br />I can't be your only one<br />No, I can't be your only one<br />'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met<br />And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?<br />No, I can't<br /><br />I can't be your only one<br />No, I can't be your only one<br />'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met<br />And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?<br />No, I can't<br /><br />As I'm layin' down with you every night<br />It still gets to me that you remain by my side<br />I ain't saying that I'm not deservin' of you<br />But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when<br /><br />I wished for living<br />In a fairytale no malice and no lies<br />Baby, oh, it's hard to believe<br />That the love you have to give is only mine<br />That's how i know<br /><br />I can't be your only one<br />No, I can't be your only one<br />'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met<br />And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?<br />No, I can't<br /><br />I can't be your only one<br />No, I can't be your only one<br />'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met<br />And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?<br />No, I can't<br /><br />Only 1<br />Be your only 1<br />Only 1<br /><br />My old account (LyricsHD2013) got suspended, so posting some of the videos from there that I still have saved on this account :({% endraw %}
