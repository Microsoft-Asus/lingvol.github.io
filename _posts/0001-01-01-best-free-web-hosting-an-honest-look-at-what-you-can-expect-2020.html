Looking for a free web hosting provider that's not completely useless? Well, in this video I'll share my findings about the best free web hosting services.<br />► Hostinger 90% OFF ➜  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://emit.reviews/go/hostinger-2020?freehost">https://emit.reviews/go/hostinger-2020?freehost</a><br />► InterServer 65% OFF➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://emit.reviews/go/interserver-2020?freehost">https://emit.reviews/go/interserver-2020?freehost</a><br />Cheap is always better than free when it comes to web hosting.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />► 000webhost ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://emit.reviews/go/000webhost-2020/">https://emit.reviews/go/000webhost-2020/</a><br />► Infinity free ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://infinityfree.net/">https://infinityfree.net/</a><br />► Wix ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://emit.reviews/go/wix-2020/">https://emit.reviews/go/wix-2020/</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />TIME TABLE<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:25 - Infinity Free<br />04:57 - 000webhost<br />8:18 - Wix<br />10:32 - Why &quot;Cheap&quot; is better than &quot;Free&quot;<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Infinity Free<br /><br />When it comes to free web hosting infinity free is offering a pretty good service in terms of performance. However, with some significant drawbacks.<br /><br />While most free web hosting providers put ads on your website or some sort of branding, InfinityFree doesn't. The way you design your site, the way it's going to stay. And that's one of the biggest reasons why I would recommend InfinityFree to people who desperately need a website with no branding.<br /><br />However, when I tested the performance their plans were a bit dodgy. It worked good IF you get it to work, but getting to the point where your website is operation, takes a bit of playing around, lots of refreshing and patience. <br /><br />Another major point is that you accept that InfinityFree can collect and share your personal data. This might lead to some data leaks. Overall, I do think that InfinityFree is one of the better free web hosting providers, but mostly for throw-away projects.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />000Webhost<br /><br />A couple of years back 000Webhost was the king of free web hosting. Offering absolutely everything you need for a website free of charge. Great performance, generous limits, additional functionality like email addresses. However, as time went by they started adding more and more limitations and removing features.<br /><br />At the moment, they're nowhere near as good of a free web hosting choice as they were, but still seem to be the most updated and consistent service out there.<br /><br />As far as free web hosting choices go, 000webhost is offering a very intuitive control panel, plenty of statistics about your website, several automated tools to help you build a website, and the only Ads you see on your dashboard and page are for Hostinger or 000webhost.<br /><br />The performance is 2-3 times slower than their paid option, but it still gets the job done.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Wix<br /><br />When we're talking about the best free web hosting providers Wix might be a weird choice, but technically they do offer free web hosting. It comes &quot;pre-packaged&quot; with their website builder tool.<br /><br />Wix is a radically different choice than 000Webhost and InfinityFree because it doesn't come with a content management system like WordPress. Instead you get to use a drag and drop style website builder. Once you're done building your website, you can host it for free.<br /><br />Wix is by far the easiest to use and the most stable free tool out there. However, at the same time it's the most limiting one as well. Even adding your own domain name will cost you $5 a month, you won't have email addresses and you can forget about complex functionality.<br /><br />In my opinion, using options like InfinityFree or 000Webhost as your free web hosting choice is a great learning experience about web hosting &amp; WordPress. While Wix is a great tool to build a good looking website fast. However, keep in mind that you will have an ad banner at the top of your website at all times.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Conclusion<br /><br />Overall, I'm not a big fan of free web hosting services, I would strongly advise against using free web hosting for actual projects as it's simply too unreliable. However, for learning purposes or testing out designs, looks both InfinityFree and 000webhost offer an excellent platform.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />- DISCLOSURE -<br /><br />I am affiliated, but not sponsored by any hosting provider.
