Brain and it was originally released in 1991. It was recently announced as an upcoming Arcade Archives title for modern consoles, so it made me pick it out of my backlog and spend some time with it. <br /><br />This is a fairly vanilla beat 'em up. The most unique thing about it is probably how you can throw enemies upward into the scenery. Walls can be damaged and broken, and they usually have score items or food inside, so it's something you're encouraged to do as often as possible. Enemies do a lot of damage too, so chances are you'll be looking for as much food as you can get. But still, it's not that hard to 1CC thanks to the two hidden 1ups in stage 5. Make sure you don't miss them!<br /><br />This isn't one of the best beat 'em ups I've played, but I enjoyed it. It's definitely worth a shot if you like the classic design of the genre.<br /><br />-----<br />Beat 'em Ups (e.g. Final Fight): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI6IYca_kvMhpG1GR9sk8OYiWQMZZTgl">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI6IYca_kvMhpG1GR9sk8OYiWQMZZTgl</a><br />2D Action (e.g. Metal Slug): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI6IYca_kvNFjpnJ59Th6N0IU1PSpD3d">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI6IYca_kvNFjpnJ59Th6N0IU1PSpD3d</a><br />STG/Shmups (e.g. Dodonpachi): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE6B3779BE759F71">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE6B3779BE759F71</a>
