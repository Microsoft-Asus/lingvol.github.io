{% raw %}Song by Sky. Here are notes from the band:<br /><br />Herbie: &quot;Masquerade comes from &quot;a real duff play called 'Maskerad' written by Lermontov in 1939. Luckily, the music was by Khatchaturian, a great composer, and not only was it much better than the play, it also sounded good on guitars.&quot;<br /><br />Steve: &quot;It was Herbie who first hummed 'Masquerade' to us, but only Tristan could remember What it was called. In the end, I did the arrangement, transposing the key and the approach to suit John's guitar better.{% endraw %}
