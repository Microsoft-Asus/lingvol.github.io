{% raw %}During Rewind: Your Week in Review, WisconsinEye senior producer Steve Walters and WisPolitics.com editor JR Ross discussed Governor Tony Evers joining other states in applying for an additional jobless benefit of $300 as ordered by President Donald Trump. The additional $300 would be added to the state weekly maximum UI benefit of $370. The first additional federal benefit of $600 per week ended in July, and no date is set for the first $300 additional benefits to start. &quot;The state got approved for three weeks of this benefit,&quot; Ross said. &quot;I was told by DWD it was encouraged to apply for a fourth week. It will take, however, six to eight weeks...to get the money, so it's not going to show up anytime soon.&quot; Ross added that under the program, there is $44 billion under FEMA to pay for these extended benefits. The U.S. House may still bargain to have some payments retroactive after that $600 additional benefit expired in July. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would like to go back to the $600 additional benefit.<br />Watch the full program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wiseye.org/2020/09/04/rewind-your-week-in-review-for-august-28-september-4/">https://wiseye.org/2020/09/04/rewind-your-week-in-review-for-august-28-september-4/</a><br />Check out more on Rewind: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wiseye.org/category/rewind-your-week-in-review/">https://wiseye.org/category/rewind-your-week-in-review/</a><br />Subscribe to Morning Minute: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wiseye.org/morning-minute/">https://wiseye.org/morning-minute/</a><br />#morningminute #rewind #wisconsineye{% endraw %}
