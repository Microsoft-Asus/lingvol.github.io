Ex-Google TechLead explains how to talk to a programmer.  This highly educational video should help normal, everyday people better understand &amp; navigate social scenarios when in the presence of a software engineer or developer.  In our current digital age, it is more and more likely that you will run into a programmer in your daily life, whether it be for professional or personal reasons.  Unbeknownst to you, a coder is often trained to think &amp; act in a manner you might find unusual or even frustrating.  I hope this video can help clarify the reasons why, and how to deal with such situations if you ever find yourself in a dangerous scenario.<br /><br />Give it a like &amp; subscribe, and let me know your thoughts in the comments below.<br />Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.<br /><br />Join ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineers for my coding interview training: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://techinterviewpro.com/">https://techinterviewpro.com/</a><br />👨‍💻 Videos of 100+ programming interview problems explained:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coderpro.com/">https://coderpro.com/</a><br />👨‍💻 Sign up for my FREE daily coding interview practice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://dailyinterviewpro.com/">http://dailyinterviewpro.com/</a><br />📷 Learn how I built a $1,000,000+ business on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtubebackstage.com/">http://youtubebackstage.com/</a><br />💵 LIMITED TIME: Get 4 FREE STOCKS ON WEBULL when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1600): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://act.webull.com/k/S4oOH2yGOtHk/main">https://act.webull.com/k/S4oOH2yGOtHk/main</a><br />🛒 My computer/camera gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amazon.com/shop/techlead">http://amazon.com/shop/techlead</a><br />🛒 The TechLead &quot;ultra-thin&quot; wallet <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WNhqEP">https://amzn.to/2WNhqEP</a><br />🛒 The TechLead custom coffee-maker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dxwrzr">https://amzn.to/3dxwrzr</a><br />🎉 Party up:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/techleadhd/">http://instagram.com/techleadhd/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/techleadhd/">http://twitter.com/techleadhd/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/pFUBUtE">https://discord.gg/pFUBUtE</a><br /><br />Disclosure: Some links are affiliate links to products.
