Read by Shane Morris<br />-<br />The Will to Win<br />by Berton Braley<br /><br />If you want a thing bad enough<br />To go out and fight for it,<br />Work day and night for it,<br />Give up your time and your peace<br />And your sleep for it,<br /><br />If only desire of it<br />Makes you quite mad enough<br />Never to tire of it,<br />Makes you hold all other things tawdry<br />And cheap for it,<br /><br />If life seems all empty<br />and useless without it<br />And all that you scheme <br />And you dream is about it,<br /><br />If gladly you'll sweat for it,<br />Fret for it, Plan for it,<br />Lose all your terror of God<br />or man for it,<br /><br />If you'll simply go after that<br />thing that you want<br />With all your capacity,<br />Strength, and sagacity,<br />Faith, hope, and confidence,<br />stern pertinacity,<br /><br />If neither cold poverty,<br />famished and gaunt,<br />Nor sickness nor pain<br />Of body and brain<br />Can turn you away from<br />the thing that you want,<br /><br />If dogged and grim you<br />besiege and beset it,<br />You'll get it.
