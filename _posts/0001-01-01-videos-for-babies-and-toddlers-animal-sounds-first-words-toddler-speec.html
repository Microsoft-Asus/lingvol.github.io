{% raw %}Our videos for babies and toddlers teach animal sounds, first words and encourage baby and toddler speech and language development learning. We use techniques recommended by speech therapists. Join us as we learn about pets and animal sounds in this fun “Talking Time” video! After pets, you will see some of our farm animal video and then some slow speech exercises. We hope you find the toddler speech learning exercises, activities and techniques helpful. <br /><br />If you think your child may have a speech delay, talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through early intervention. You can also get an assessment from a speech therapist. The sooner you get help, the better! <br /><br />Just to be clear, we ourselves are not speech therapists. Rachel has a masters in music education and teaches preschool music.  She has also taught many toddler classes. If you are in New York City and are seeking a speech therapist, check out www.chatterboxnyc.com The brilliant speech therapists at Chatterbox are highly recommended and helped with our “Speech Techniques for Toddlers” video. <br /><br />We also include toddler songs and baby songs in our toddler speech learning videos. Simple songs can help the development of language and gestures! Gestures and imitation are building blocks that help with language development. We also include some sign language and pretend play. Baby sign language can help with the development of language and will not impede the development of language and speech. We also model pretend play. Pretend play is an important toddler skill. <br /><br />In this video we will go over the following animal sounds: Dog, cat, bunny rabbit and farm animals, cow, duck, pig, sheep and horse. Animal sounds are a great way to encourage your child to make sounds and experiment with their voice. A fun toy that may encourage language is a toy barn with toy farm animals. You can get right down on the floor at your child’s level and make the animal sounds. It may help to hold a toy by your mouth so they look at the way your mouth produces the sounds.<br /><br />This video may also be helpful to children with apraxia, autism, down syndrome and other developmental delays and special needs. We hope the speech activities, exercises, lessons and training are helpful! This video is great for a baby, 1 year old, 2 year old, 3 year old, 4 year old and even older! <br /><br />On our channel, we have many more speech practice videos (see our speech playlist) and we also have free preschool class videos (see our preschool class playlist) and full music classes! We have videos for babies, videos for toddlers and videos for kids. Our videos for toddlers are in English. In our videos we work on speech and language, milestones, gestures, pretend play, social emotional learning, dramatic play, art, music, math, science, circle time, finger plays, sensory play and many more activities! We’d love for you to become part of our Songs for Littles family! <br /><br />If you are looking for videos for babies, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds or even 5 year olds, our videos will be excellent choices. <br /><br />#videosforbabies #videosfortoddlers #firstwords #animalsounds #toddlerspeech #animalsoundsfortoddlers #petsounds #farmanimalsounds #animalsoundsforbabies #speechdelay #speechfortoddlers #speechdevelopment #firstwords #farmanimals #babysignlanguage #animalsoundssong #apraxia #learningvideos <br /><br />Rachel teaches preschool music to young kids, toddlers, and babies and has a master's in music education from NYU.
