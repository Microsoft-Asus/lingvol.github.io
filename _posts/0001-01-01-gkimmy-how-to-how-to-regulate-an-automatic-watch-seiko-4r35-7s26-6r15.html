Hello,<br />I wanted to make a quick and easy video about how to regulate an Automatic/Mechanical watch movement for when you watch is running too fast or too slow.<br /><br />This video applies to MOST Seiko/Citizen/Orient watches.<br />Other movements may have slight differences to how the lever is adjusted, such as a screw for fine tuning.
