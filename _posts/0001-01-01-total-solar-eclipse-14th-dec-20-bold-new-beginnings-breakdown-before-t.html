{% raw %}Following on the heels of the Lunar eclipse two weeks ago, we are now bracing for the south node total solar eclipse in Sagittarius. Interestingly, Mercury is also conjunct this eclipse degree and that adds more spice to the energies. <br /><br />Its a Breakdown Before The Breakthrough. Therefore, do not fear about making the changes and taking your decisions to move ahead. Don't drag your feet. Avoid resistance and procrastination. Instead face up the situation with positivity and the right attitude.<br /><br />Unexpected events happen but they are all for the right purpose and we need to embrace that with open hearts and a winning attitude. Things are happening for good and we need to always remember that (although it might feel a bit uncertain or disconcerting for a while).<br /><br />The Great Conjunction of Saturn-Jupiter on 21st is the apogee of the 2020 energies ushering us in the new Aquarian age. My webinar on 20th Dec 2020 details this extraordinary event will cover that in detail. Please join me for that webinar.
