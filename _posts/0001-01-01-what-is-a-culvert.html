Discussing the hydraulics of the humble highway culvert.<br /><br />Culverts are ubiquitous in the constructed world. They seem so obvious that you may never consider them. But, the engineering behind culverts is quite complicated and exciting. Next time you're driving or walking along a street, keep an eye out for culverts. See if you can identify whether the culvert is outlet or inlet controlled and be thankful that we have this ordinary, but remarkable, bit of infrastructure to let you safely walk or drive right over.<br /><br />@Federal Highway Administration USDOTFHWA Culvert Hydraulics Video [44:05] <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnXmGyb_hKQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnXmGyb_hKQ</a><br /><br />-Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/PracticalEngineering">http://patreon.com/PracticalEngineering</a><br />-Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://practical.engineering">http://practical.engineering</a><br /><br />Writing/Editing/Production: Grady Hillhouse<br />Editing and Direction Help: Wesley Crump<br /><br />Tonic and Energy by Elexive is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License<br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fBPdu8w9U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fBPdu8w9U</a><br /><br />This video is sponsored by NordVPN.
