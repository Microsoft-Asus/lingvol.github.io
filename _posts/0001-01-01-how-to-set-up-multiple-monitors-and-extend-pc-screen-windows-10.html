Here, I am going to show you how you can set up and configure multiple displays (monitor/ TV) in windows 10 computer. <br /><br />You can connect a secondary device via HDMI cable or VGA cable just like a projector. <br /><br />Connect the cable first with your secondary device, then connect the other end of the cable with your PC. You will hear a bip sound, this indicates that your computer recognizes the new device. For a television you need to select input method now. For monitor you don't need to do this. <br /><br />Switching between display modes<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />To bring the display mode in windows 10 press (windows + P ) keys together. On laptop extend is selected by default, for PC duplicate would be selected by default. <br /><br />PC screen only — Only the primary monitor is used nothing on your secondary display.  <br />Duplicate — Secondary monitor shows duplicate desktop (same as primary screen). <br />Extend — Both monitors combine to offer an extended desktop. Second screen only — Only the secondary monitor is used.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------<br />If you LIKE this video give it a thumbs up by pressing the like button 👍 👍 👍 <br />Please don't forget to share with your friends 🙋🤵👳👴👦👨👩 <br />Click here to subscribe to my channel  : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/hckG5w">https://goo.gl/hckG5w</a><br /><br />আমার বাংলা চ্যানেলঃ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAbE-s80y8wjd2Pd-u-YqFA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAbE-s80y8wjd2Pd-u-YqFA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />This will inspire me to make more videos for you all 💞<br />If you have any suggestion or question, please feel free to share it in comment section.
