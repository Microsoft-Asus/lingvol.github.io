It is both a prayer campaign and a network of thousands of faith-filled Catholics committed to praying for our nation the way the Lord instructed St. Faustina Kowalska to pray for her country of Poland in the 1930s. A four-part Action Plan is presented based on the writings of St. Faustina. In addition, members can choose to join various email and/or text groups to received special notifications such as the daily prayers for several novenas throughout the year.<br /><br />The first part of the DMFA Action Plan is for each of us to commit to striving for our own personal holiness so that we are the best possible citizens of this world and the next and so that we may be led only by the Holy Spirit and God's Divine Will. The several thousand team members are active in the spiritual battle routinely participating in various novenas of prayer as well as taking to the streets marching and standing vigil with blessed images of Jesus, the Divine Mercy and Our Lady of Guadalupe to help eradicate evil and convert the hearts of those who gaze upon Him, and it works.<br /><br />In 2018 construction of a new office facility with a state of the art podcast studio was completed on the property in central Texas. Informative podcasts are regularly produced and published on the Divine Mercy for America Facebook page and Youtube channel.<br /><br />Subscribe to the Divine Mercy for America YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekqDxnI1kF8AZ9tgRY4QjA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekqDxnI1kF8AZ9tgRY4QjA</a><br /><br />Find DMFA on Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DivineMercyForAmerica/">https://www.facebook.com/DivineMercyForAmerica/</a><br /><br />Sponsored by the Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.marian.org/">https://www.marian.org/</a><br />Marian Fathers Divine Mercy website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedivinemercy.org/">https://www.thedivinemercy.org/</a><br />The National Shrine of Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shrineofdivinemercy.org/">https://www.shrineofdivinemercy.org/</a><br />Do you feel called to become a Marian Priest or Brother?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fathercalloway.com/">https://www.fathercalloway.com/</a><br /><br />MOMM is a proud member of CEMA - Coalition of Eucharistic and Marian Apostolates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coalitionofapostolates.com/">https://coalitionofapostolates.com/</a><br /><br />Jesus, I Trust in You!
