This fantastic book from Usborne Publishing is a toy and a book in one. Each page features an embedded train track - wind up the toy train and place it on the page to see it chug round the railway line. A section of each page also lifts out and becomes a giant jigsaw piece - link them together to create a huge floor puzzle, and watch as the wind-up train whizzes all around that as well! Makes a brilliant gift (RRP Â£19.99) - buy from all good bookshops, from your local Usborne Independent Organiser, or online from the Usborne website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usborne.com/">https://usborne.com/</a>
