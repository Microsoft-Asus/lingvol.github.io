In the synoptic gospels, we read of the story of Jesus healing the woman who had an issue of blood. The woman had tried unsuccessfully for twelve long years to be healed. According to the Law of Moses, because she constantly was bleeding she was considered ritually unclean, and thus should not touch anyone else as they would become unclean as well. She also was unable to worship at the Temple as she was always in a state of ritual impurity. The healing touch of Jesus restored her to everyday life and temple worship, the same blessing He can do for us.<br /><br />Sign up for email notifications for new videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2uV4vlo">https://bit.ly/2uV4vlo</a><br />For more videos on the Life of Christ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2FgnMlS">https://bit.ly/2FgnMlS</a><br /><br />For the text of this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://redeemer-of-israel.blogspot.com/2015/02/tzitzit-and-healed-woman.html">http://redeemer-of-israel.blogspot.com/2015/02/tzitzit-and-healed-woman.html</a><br /><br />Special thanks to:<br />Appian Media for allowing me to use some of their beautiful video footage of Israel, find more about their amazing projects here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://appianmedia.org/">https://appianmedia.org/</a><br /><br />If you would like to help translate the subtitles visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?v=zwwITGLlcyM&amp;ref=share">http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?v=zwwITGLlcyM&amp;ref=share</a><br /><br />Â© 2019 Daniel Smith, Messages of Christ YouTube Channel<br />No portion of this video may be reproduced, re-uploaded, or copied without prior permission.<br /><br />The products (services) offered by Messages of Christ are neither made, provided, approved nor endorsed by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
