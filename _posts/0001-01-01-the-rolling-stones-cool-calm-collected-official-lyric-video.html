“Cool, Calm &amp; Collected” by The Rolling Stones<br />Composers: Mick Jagger and Keith Richards<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Well, she's very wealthy it's true<br />So in that she is one up on you<br />She's dressed all in red, white and blue<br />And she always knows more than you do<br /><br />She's so affected<br />Cool, calm, collected<br /><br />She knows who to smile to today<br />She has just been brought up in that way<br />She knows all the right games to play<br />And she always just knows what to say<br /><br />She's well respected<br />Cool, calm, collected<br /><br />Hello<br /><br />She's so affected<br />Cool, calm, collected<br /><br />In public the strain's hard to bear<br />She exudes such a confident air<br />But behind she is not without care<br />But she sweeps it right under her hair<br /><br />She's well respected<br />Cool, calm, collected<br /><br />She seems to glow brilliantly white<br />And her hair seems to shine in the night<br />With her feet unbelievably light<br />And her teeth ready, sharpened to bite<br /><br />She's so respected<br />Cool, calm, collected<br /><br />“Cool, Calm &amp; Collected (Official Lyric Video)”<br />Directed by: Lucy Dawkins and Tom Readdy at Yes Please Productions<br />Executive Producer: Julian Klein<br />Producer: Dina Kanner<br />(C) 2020 ABKCO Music &amp; Records, Inc. <br /><br />#TheRollingStones #CoolCalmCollected #OfficialLyricVideo<br /><br />Music video by The Rolling Stones performing Cool, Calm &amp; Collected (Lyric Video). © 2020 ABKCO Music &amp; Records, Inc.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/gNqnzw">http://vevo.ly/gNqnzw</a>
