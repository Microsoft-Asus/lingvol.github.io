{% raw %}Join us as we head down to Virginia Beach to see the Drive-Thru Boardwalk Lights. We spent a little time on the beach and mainly watched from our balcony. While on the beach we saw a few dolphins. Next time I will look into going horseback riding. Please stay tuned for part two of the actual footage of the lights. We will be stopping through Williamsburg, Virginia, on the way home to visit the Yankee Candle store. <br /><br />Amazon Ring Light<br />Ring Light 10.2'' Ring Light with Stand OEBLD Selfie Ring Light: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3a2ygGC">https://amzn.to/3a2ygGC</a>  <br />Ring Light Led Ring Light - 10&quot; Selfie Ring Light with Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/377MDI1">https://amzn.to/377MDI1</a> <br /> ( As an Amazon Affiliate, I  receive small commissions for qualified purchases.)<br /> Let's Stay Connected on Social Media<br />Blog Coming Soon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shaniecebe.com/">http://shaniecebe.com/</a>  <br />Facebook: ShanieceBe <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/shaniecebe-110333624022917">https://www.facebook.com/shaniecebe-110333624022917</a> <br />IG: ShanieceBe <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shaniecebe/">https://www.instagram.com/shaniecebe/</a> <br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shaniecebe?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@shaniecebe?lang=en</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/shaniecebe">https://twitter.com/shaniecebe</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/Shaniecebe/motivational-quotes/">https://www.pinterest.com/Shaniecebe/motivational-quotes/</a><br />William my Son IG: AdorableWilliam <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/adorablewil...">https://www.instagram.com/adorablewil...</a> <br />_____________________________________________________________________________ <br />B U S I N E S S:<br /><br />â‡¢ For business inquiries ONLY, such as company sponsors or reviews, please feel free to email me at shaniecebe@gmail.com. <br /><br />Please note this video is not a reflection of my current employer.
