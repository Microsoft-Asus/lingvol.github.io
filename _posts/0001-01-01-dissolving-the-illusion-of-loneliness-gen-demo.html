{% raw %}A beautiful excerpt from Gen Demo's talk on Dissolving the Illusion of Loneliness.<br /><br />This lecture explains how this perception of ourselves as separate from others is an illusion, for in truth we are all naturally and profoundly interconnected. By learning to understand and feel this connection weâ€™ll reduce our sense of isolation, allowing a natural closeness and authentic love for others to arise. Through this wisdom passed down from Buddha, we can transform our outlook on life, heal our relationships, and lay the foundation for universal love.{% endraw %}
