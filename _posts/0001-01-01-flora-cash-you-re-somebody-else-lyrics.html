I saw the part of you<br />That only when you're older you will see too<br />You will see too<br />I held the better cards<br />But every stroke of luck has got a bleed through<br />It's got a bleed through<br />You held the balance of the time<br />That only blindly I could read you<br />But I could read you<br />It's like you told me<br />Go forward slowly<br />It's not a race to the end<br /><br />Well you look like yourself<br />But you're somebody else<br />Only it ain't on the surface<br />Well you talk like yourself<br />No, I hear someone else though<br />Now you're making me nervous<br /><br />You were the better part<br />Of every bit of beating heart that I had<br />Whatever I had<br />I finally sat alone<br />Pitch black flesh and bone<br />Couldn't believe that you were gone<br /><br />Well you look like yourself<br />But you're somebody else<br />Only it ain't on the surface<br />Well you talk like yourself<br />No, I hear someone else though<br />Now you're making me nervous<br /><br />Well you look like yourself<br />But you're somebody else<br />Only it ain't on the surface<br />Well you talk like yourself<br />No, I hear someone else though<br />Now you're making me nervous<br /><br />Where are we?<br />Where are we?<br /><br />Well you look like yourself<br />But you're somebody else<br />Only it ain't on the surface<br />Well you talk like yourself<br />No, I hear someone else though<br />Now you're making me nervous<br /><br />Well you look like yourself<br />But you're somebody else<br />Only it ain't on the surface<br />Well you talk like yourself<br />No, I hear someone else though<br />Now you're making me nervous<br /><br />I saw the part of you that only when you're older<br />You will see too, you will see too
