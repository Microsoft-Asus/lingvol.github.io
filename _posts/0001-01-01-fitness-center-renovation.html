Renovation of the Fitness Center on the Hammond Campus at Purdue University Northwest<br /><br />The video opens with a renovation crew preparing to lay down flooring and quickly progresses through the entire floor being covered with black flooring tiles. Once the floor is completed, the crew brings in massive boxes and equipment wrapped in plastic. The cardboard boxes and plastic is removed to reveal an array of new exercise equipment including stair step machines, tread mills, weight lifting equipment and elliptical machines. The crew places the equipment in the room and the video fades to reveal a before and after scene showing the area before renovation and equipment installation and after all the equipment was unwrapped and placed. Scenes include a wall of free weights, yoga/Pilates studio and people working out in the new gym space.
