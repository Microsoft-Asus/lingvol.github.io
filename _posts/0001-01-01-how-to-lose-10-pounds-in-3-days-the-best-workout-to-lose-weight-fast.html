Shoot for the moon, get the stars!<br /><br />You always wanted to know which 1 of  my weight loss workouts is the best to help you lose weight as fast as possible AND the answer is in the video you watched (or actually got off your butt and did)<br /><br />Here's the workout plan where you will Spend 9 Minutes Looking Better &amp; 5 Minutes Visualizing How Much Better You'll Look.<br /><br />+Look Better for 1 minute <br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 1 minute<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 45 Sec.<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 30 Sec.<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 15 Sec.<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 15 Sec.<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 30 Sec.<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 45 Sec.<br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br />+Rest &amp; Imagine How Much Better You'll Look for 1 minute <br />+Look Better for 1 minute<br /><br />Repeat this 1 more time to get a FULL 30-minute workout. Do the workout to lose 10 pounds 1-to-2 times per day at least twice a week.<br /><br />If soreness prevents you from doing it at least 2x a week, Then Do my other NO-Impact best weight Loss Workouts (like Bed sheet, Elliptical &amp; Bike workouts) included in my Fat Loss Plan at NowLoss.com/adrian<br /><br />Optional: To Burn EVEN More Fat, Do it Fasted (before your 1st meal/breakfast) &amp;/or Take Caffeine 30 minutes before.<br /><br />You are not doing chair burpees; YOU ARE DOING an EXERCISE CALLED 'LOOK BETTERS'<br /><br />Try to get the same number, MORE (or 70%) of LOOK BETTERS every minute. Here's the math on that,<br /><br />*70% of 20 LOOK BETTERS or Chair Burpees is 14<br />*70% of 30 LOOK BETTERS is 21<br />*70% of 40 LOOK BETTERS is 28<br />*70% of 50 LOOK BETTERS is 35<br />*70% of 60 LOOK BETTERS is 42<br /><br />And at the end of the workout where you go 2 minutes straight you will DOUBLE that<br /><br />Remember: put your chair against a wall, on a carpet or a non-slick surface or Don't use a chair. You can do this using a table, dresser, your bed, car or truck.<br /><br />Too hard? Then go higher meaning raise the level or elevation of the object you're doing the 'LOOK BETTERS' off of. So, you can go as low as a chair all the way to standing straight up doing them off a wall (while facing the wall)<br /><br />DO NOT DO REGULAR BURPEES! Chair burpees (or look betters) may seem easier but they are actually better for fat loss because they force you to go faster. This makes it more intense than the regular burpees or FULL burpees you do off the floor plus,<br /><br />Look Betters (the chair burpees) also give a good lower ab workout which will tone &amp; tighten up your lower abs to instantly make your stomach look flatter while at the same time,<br /><br />You are also literally losing belly fat to TRULY get a flat belly! So again, DO NOT do regular burpees.<br /><br />How can you tell if you'll lose at least 10 pounds in a week doing this weight loss workout? You just answer these questions,<br /><br />+Is it Kicking Your A$$?<br />+Are you thinking about quitting but Imaging your future self keeps you going?<br />+Are you getting MORE, the same amount or 70% of chair burpees every minute?<br /><br />If you answered YES to any of the 3 questions above = You will Lose Weight Fast EVEN if you're doing the so called &quot;easier&quot; or low-impact version. WHATEVER KICKS YOUR BUTT (and nobody else's) is what will work for YOU!<br /><br />BUT make sure you go to NowLoss.com/adrian, get my fat loss plan and USE the ‘HOW TO EAT' section because, <br /><br />More Low Impact Workouts <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joRPZL8SFn0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joRPZL8SFn0</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe8xi13vbE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe8xi13vbE</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkLFPGuF-tQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkLFPGuF-tQ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsr3LDkbM0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsr3LDkbM0M</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzveroBplo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzveroBplo</a><br /><br />NOT EVEN this lose 10 pounds fast (BY YESTERDAY) workout WILL NOT WORK if you don't know how to lose weight eating foods you're already eating (like cake, pizza &amp; ice cream or healthy foods)
