It is not my best work since I didn't really had time to put much effort into it. <br />I just watched episode 2x11 of The Originals and when Finn tried to find out what Klaus is hiding from him...I don't know every piece of it reminded me so much of my lovely Caroline Forbes...so I just had to make this.<br /><br />What did you thought of the idea (I know the editing is crap :-()
