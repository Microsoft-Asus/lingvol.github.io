{% raw %}Grazze &amp; Nuage combine their expert abilities for their 3-part ‘Aulos’ EP on @Purified Records. Opening with the EP’s titular track, the duo construct a slice of downtempo breakbeat that transports the listener to the dance floor with an industrial energy and euphoric elements. Their second offering ‘Whoever You Want To Be’ is a smooth melodic cut, which infuses a spoken verse with a gentle instrumental arrangement, resulting in a therapeutic piece of dance music that will soothe the listener to their core. Reworking the B-Side in a deep and mysterious rendition, Deeparture transforms ‘Whoever You Want To Be’ into a club-ready creation that adds another dimension to the EP.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ttps://purifiedrecords.lnk.to/AulosEP">ttps://purifiedrecords.lnk.to/AulosEP</a><br /><br />www.purifiedrecords.com<br />www.facebook.com/purifiedrecords<br />www.youtube.com/purifiedrecords<br />www.instagram.com/purifiedrecords<br />www.twitter.com/purifiedrec{% endraw %}
