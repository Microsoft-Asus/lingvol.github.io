The Super Mario Brothers Super Show is a zany animated fantasy adventure comedy based on Nintendoâ€™s most popular video game. The stars are the world-famous Mario and Luigi, two laugh-provoking plumbers from Brooklyn who suddenly find themselves washed through a Warp Zone.<br />#SuperHero #CartoonsForKids #SuperPowers
