Did you guys hear Zara Larsson's new song? It's great. 10/10. Great dancing. Beat is good too. Give it a listen if you haven't yet. <br /><br />There is one month left before I go back to school. I am not prepared. I feel like I just got on break. <br /><br />Anyways, that's all from me for now. I will try to post a video tomorrow. We'll see how I feel. Update: too tired lol. Will have to pass up on the video lol.<br /><br />have a nice Saturday,<br />Jill Ck√•rsgard
