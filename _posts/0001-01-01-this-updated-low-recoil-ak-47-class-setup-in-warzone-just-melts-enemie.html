{% raw %}The AK-47 is a weapon I really enjoy using in Warzone and this updated low recoil AK-47 class setup in Warzone just melts people! High damage output, low recoil and good movement speed... it just works! Using the Monolithic Suppressor, 23&quot; Romanian barrel, Tac Laser, Corp Combat Holo sight and 40-round mags, this round gets intense with Specialist Bonus pickups, Juggernaut kills and even a wipe of another streamer team! Try this Warzone AK-47 best class setup (best loadout) and let me know what you think of it down in the comments.

At the moment I'm really enjoying playing Call of Duty Warzone whilst we wait for Battlefield 6 gameplay, details and information. I mainly do Battlefield 5 gameplay and Battlefield sniping on all the different games: Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 3. I often play solos, duos and squads. I have 1000 hours experience in every Battlefield and I hope to play more FPS games in 2020. I hope you enjoy my sniper gameplay and Warzone gameplay as much as I do making it.{% endraw %}
