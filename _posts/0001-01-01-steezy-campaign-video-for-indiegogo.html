<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://igg.me/at/steezy">https://igg.me/at/steezy</a><br /><br />Here's a brief rundown of my proposed solo album! This is something I've wanted to do for many years now, but never had the time due to my touring schedule being so full on. <br /><br />Music is what I'm truly passionate about, not just drumming. That's why I want to compose a record where I can express myself in every way possible, not only via the kit. I will have zero restrictions, and total freedom to create the best possible music for you guys, and hopefully inspire more to create too :)<br /><br />If you like what this project is about then please join me in shaping this product, and hopefully this will be the first of many solo albums! Thank you guys as always, Chris<br /><br />Video by @Axel Grassi-Havnen and audio by @benderrecording
