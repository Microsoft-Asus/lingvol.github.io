{% raw %}That feeling when you're utterly drained of energy, and nothing can entice you to get off the couch and get moving.<br />Low energy levels can make it difficult to be productive at work or to engage in everyday activities.Feeling Tired All the Time<br />Fortunately, there are natural ways to get a lift in energy. Whether they are quick fixes that work in the short-term, or lifestyle habits that help you to have longer-lasting energy with longer term benefits, here are top 6 natural energy boosters.<br /><br />1.Increase your magnesium.<br />magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in our body, including baking glucose down into energy. This means that low magnesium levels can have a very quick impact on our energy levels, causing them to drop. <br />Magnesium rich food includes spinach, chard, bananas, almonds, Avocado, etc.<br />You can also try taking an Epsom salt bath which not only relaxes your muscles but will make you sleep better at night.<br /><br />2.Start your day with Lemon water. Lemon-juice is packed with electrolytes like magnesium and potassium, which are essential for energy production. Squeeze juice out of half a lemon and add it to 150 ml of warm water. Add a pinch of salt and drink it first thing in the morning to start your day off with an energy boost.<br /><br />3.Get plenty of sleep each night. While you sleep, your body repairs itself and the brain restores its energy supply so that you can wake up in the morning feeling ready for the day. Depriving yourself of sleep can drain your body because sleep acts like a charger that charges your brain cells and replenishes your energy levels.<br />• Adults typically need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night.<br />• To sleep better, try having a warm glass of milk with a pinch of turmeric powder before bedtime.<br /><br /><br />4.Get more Exercise. Physical activity is a known energy booster, and can also help you get a better night's sleep. Physical activity releases ‘happy hormones’ called endorphins. Endorphins helps in elevating the mood and regulation of your appetite, all of which can help to boost your energy levels.<br /><br />5.Drink plenty of water. Inadequate water consumption can lead to dehydration, which causes fatigue and feelings of low-energy. Help fight fatigue by staying hydrated throughout the day.<br />• Experts recommend drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water each day to stay properly hydrated.<br /><br />6.Laugh!<br />Laughter is so important in this stressful world. A good belly laugh can raise your blood pressure and boost your heart rate. This means more oxygen-rich blood travelling through your brain and your body, and a quick boost of positive energy.<br /><br /><br /><br />It isn't nice to feel drained, but often it's a vicious cycle. We feel too tired to exercise or eat properly, which only saps our vitality more. The best advice? Use those last traces of energy to get up, have a drink of water and eat some energy food. Go for a quick ten-minute walk, have a stretch, and you'll feel a whole lot better.<br /><br />Please Subscribe! ▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ksfh7M">https://goo.gl/ksfh7M</a><br /><br />Images licensed under Creative Commons:<br />www.pixabay.com<br />canstockphoto.com<br />www.wikihow.com<br /><br />please note: The materials and the information contained on Natural ways channel are provided for general and educational purposes only and do not constitute any legal, medical or other professional advice on any subject matter.
