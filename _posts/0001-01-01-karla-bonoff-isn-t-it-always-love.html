Singer/Songwriter Karla Bonoff was the author of many hits for other artists in the mid-late 1970's, including Linda Ronstadt, Lynn Anderson and Bonnie Raitt. Her debut self titled album from 1977 featured the three songs she penned for Linda's Grammy winning 1976 album &quot;Hasten down the wind&quot; as well as this beautiful track which is the subject of this post, and which i discovered two years after the original was released, when my favourite singer of the time - Nicolette Larson recorded it for her sophmore set &quot;In the Nick of Time&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Isn't it always love&quot; is a catchy but tender song and Karla's warm and textured voice gives it a vulnerability and perhaps personal resonance, whereas Nicolette's has more oomph, perhaps less biographical. &quot;In the nick of time&quot; is one of my all time favourite albums, and Karla's contribution via &quot;Isn't it always love&quot; is still pure Nicolette - a bit pop, a bit folk, a bit country - and she still makes it her own. It is always interesting to discover the versions that songwriters memorialised for themselves, after the big name recording artist had already done so. Randy Edelman, Carole Bayer Sager, Peter Allen and Melissa Manchester all have some wonderful versions of their own tracks that they were hired to write for the superstars of the day, such as The Carpenters, Barry Manilow, Bette Midler and The Captain &amp; Tennille. There is something more meaningful perhaps when the original writer creates their own version - often quieter, with less razzle, but perfectly pitched and reflecting their own stories and concerns.<br /><br />Karla Bonoff would return to my consciousness with her U.S hit of 1982 - ironically her cover of  Jackie Moore's 1978 hit &quot;Personally&quot; giving her the biggest American chart success she would achieve,  Her contribution to the 'Footloose' soundtrack, &quot;Somebody's Eyes&quot; was also something of a favourite in 1984. (Again not one of her songs, but from the Oscar/Grammy winners Dean Pitchford and Tom Snow) I guess that's just the way it goes. Melissa Manchester would have her biggest pop hits with songs that she did not write, despite being a prolific pen for so many artists. 'Don't Cry out Loud' penned by Peter Allen and Carole Bayer Sager, and 'You should hear how she talks about you' by spookily enough Dean Pitchford &amp; Tom Snow! <br /><br />Karla Bonoff has continued to write, record and tour.<br />I hope all who listen to Ms Bonoff enjoy the experience.
