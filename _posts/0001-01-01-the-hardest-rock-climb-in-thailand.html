Incredible climb of the hardest Sport Climbing Route in Thailand. After breaking his finger on this climb three years ago Steve Townshend came back to try it again.<br /><br />It was very nice to meet this amazing Vegan powered climbing machine. He inspired me to climb harder and even to find a project of my own... (more on that latter) And most important, to enjoy climbing it self without stressing about the goal (send) too much.<br /><br />So, Enjoy! And if you do don't forget the like button!<br />Peace And Love!<br /><br />Music:<br />&quot;The Complex&quot; Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>
