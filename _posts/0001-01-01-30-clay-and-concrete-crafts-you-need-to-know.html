AMAZING THINGS YOU CAN MAKE WITH CEMENT<br /><br /><br /><br />To help you get creative and give some color to your stuff around you, I demonstrate some tips and tutorials using both clay, concrete, and a bunch of other tools. <br /><br />For starters, take an ice-cream cone, fill it with cement, and then use it to organize your jewelry. <br /><br />Another great DIY hack is to add cement in a Ziplock bag, then pour it in an ice tray, add some paper clips on the top, and then use them as little paper organizers for your desk. <br /><br /> You can also make amazing furniture using cement. Or, if you have old books, recycle them into a stand for your lamp by soaking them into cement. <br /><br />You can also use an old candy container as a mold for your cement. After it dries, apply some gold acrylic paint to it to give it some color and then attach a ring to it to make beautiful jewelry. <br /><br />Watch until the end to see how to make polymer clay jewelry and other amazing DIY crafts for beginners. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Timestamps: <br /><br />1:16 – How to recycle books<br /><br />3:44 – Cute polymer clay earrings<br /><br />6:18 – DIY cement plant pots<br /><br />7:23 – How to make earrings using polymer clay<br /><br />10:06 – Adorable windmill décor<br /><br />14:35 – Genius modeling clay crafts<br /><br />17:42 – How to repurpose tights <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
