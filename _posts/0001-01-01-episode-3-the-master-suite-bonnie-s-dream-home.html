{% raw %}C'mon gang, we all love master suites and the idea of creating the ultimate parents retreat sits atop most people's wish list when renovating their dream home. So we're super pumped to share with you some master suite inspo for the ages. Yeah, yeah we hear you ....Â  the kitchen from last week is a pretty hard act to follow but trust us when we say the master suite reveal is just the ticket to keep this modern coastal barn rocketing into the stratosphere (where, incidentally, you can see Bon's island bench from ;-). So get your iPhone, iPad and laptops fully charged people..... Episode Three is coming in hot !!! #mastersuitemayhem #bonniesdreamhome{% endraw %}
