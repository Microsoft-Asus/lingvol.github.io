Growing up, Cody Young always struggled with his weight. He was 130 lb. as a third grader and weighed in at 320 lb. as a high-school sophomore.<br /><br />At the end of his junior year, he was rejected by a girl and his confidence took a major hit.<br /><br />“I had this warped idea that people didn’t like me because I was overweight,” Young says. “Growing up, that’s kind of what you think. You think that every single thing that’s bad that happens to you, ‘Oh, it’s because I’m fat.’”<br /><br />When Young tackled his first workout at North Rim CrossFit in Chico, California, he was able to finish the prescribed five rounds, but it hurt more than he expected. The experience made him realize he wasn’t in the shape he thought he was.<br /><br />“I decided that I’m tired of being overweight,” Young posted on Facebook.<br /><br />He committed to a healthy diet and consistent workouts at the gym. Though his initial goal was to lose 50 lb., he ended up shedding more than 100 lb. in just over a year. Young participated in his first CrossFit competition and started hitting new PRs, sharing his accomplishments on social media. Today, he’s fit, confident and proud of the decision he made.<br /><br />“I didn’t lose weight because I was some special case,” Young says. “No, I made the decision to lose weight. Anybody can do it. You just have to own up to it; you have to realize that you can take control.”<br /><br />Video by Stephen Diaz<br /><br />The CrossFit Journal -- (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://journal.crossfit.com)">http://journal.crossfit.com)</a><br /><br />The CrossFit Games® - The Sport of Fitness™<br />The Fittest On Earth™
