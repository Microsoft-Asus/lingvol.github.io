Meeko the 8 year old white bellied caique is extremely intrigued by the bottoms of doors, cracks between beds, and for some reason, he is very confused by the corner of the sink in the bathroom. He tries to find a way to look down the crack, and even attempts to see if he can fit. Sadly, the attempts are unsuccessful, but he doesn't give up!<br /><br />Source &amp; embed code: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/v626o3-meeko-confused-my-corners.html.">https://rumble.com/v626o3-meeko-confused-my-corners.html.</a><br /><br />For licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.
