Back pain can be caused by many things. These simple back exercises and stretches can be done with most diagnoses. Purchase the Artree Acupressure Set featured in this video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bdCo4E">https://amzn.to/3bdCo4E</a> (affiliate link)<br /><br /><br /><br />Buy a printable worksheet with the Back Pain Treatments in this video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.askdoctorjo.com/back-pain-relief-worksheet">https://www.askdoctorjo.com/back-pain-relief-worksheet</a><br /><br />The first exercises for back pain are more to get your low back and hips warmed up and moving. Pelvic tilts and bridges are great exercises and stretches combined.<br /><br /><br /><br />Another great way to relieve back pain is by using an acupressure mat. The folks at Artree Company sent me their Artree Acupressure Set. It is great for improving circulation to the back area to help relieve muscle tightness and pain.<br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, some stretches will help reduce back pain as well. A simple knee to chest stretch and child’s pose are great ways to loosen up the muscles of the back.<br /><br />Related Videos:<br /><br />7 Ways to Relieve Back Pain:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egUwbMa1TeU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egUwbMa1TeU</a><br /><br />10 Best Back Pain Relief Exercises &amp; Stretches (Basic):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RmGdDluCp8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RmGdDluCp8</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br /><br /><br />Dr. Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.<br /><br /><br /><br />SUPPORT Ask Doctor Jo on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo">http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br /><br /><br />5 Back Pain Relief Treatments:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFaarJsrJFQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFaarJsrJFQ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.askdoctorjo.com/back-pain-relief-artree">https://www.askdoctorjo.com/back-pain-relief-artree</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.
