The final two videos of this channel's existence are two videos I've been wanting to make for YEARS. Literally, since I've started the channel here. Now the time seems fitting, and the first video off the bucket list is a (very very speedy) video about the 434 day reign for CM Punk. Not a lot of people have tackled this subject and managed to keep the video under 8 or 9 minutes while tacking on every point you can show. This was a very difficult video to make under those parameters, but it had to be done. <br /><br />To keep things unique, I used a couple of tracks from the Ilinoise album by Sufjan Stevens. If you've been a subscriber since December of 2014, you may have seen the video of Punk v Jericho where I used 'Chicago' off the album. This time, I'm using 'Come On! Feel the Illinoise!' and 'They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!' <br /><br />Seems to be fitting enough. <br /><br />The last video will come on Thursday. Surely, this channel will end on a match highlight. Surely, it's a match I've been needing to do ever since I've started. And you bet, I'll finally make it happen.
