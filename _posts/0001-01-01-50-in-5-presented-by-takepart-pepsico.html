{% raw %}PepsiCo, the owner of Lays and Walkers potato chips, launched 50 in 5 in the United Kingdom five years ago. The program aims to reduce the carbon and water footprints of the company's potato supply by 50 percent in five years. To achieve that goal, the soda and snack giant needed to work closely with nonprofits, develop new technologies to convince farmers to change their practices. They managed to do it and are looking to expand the program.
