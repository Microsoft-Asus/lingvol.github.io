Pfizer’s shares dropped after a report said the U.S. drugmaker expects to ship half of the Covid-19 vaccines it originally planned for this year due to supply-chain problems. Pfizer is now planning to ship 50 million vaccines by the end of the year, down from the original 100 million it hoped to send out initially. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, joins Shepard Smith to discuss potential supply chain issues.
