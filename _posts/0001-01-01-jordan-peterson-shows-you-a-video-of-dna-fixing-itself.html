{% raw %}In this lecture, he makes the case that we each inhabit a story, describing where we are, where we are going, and the actions we must undertake to get from the former to the latter.<br /><br /> These inhabited stories are predicated on an underlying value system (as we must want to be where we are going more than we value where we are).<br /><br /> In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing on our current frame), and determine emotional significance (positive: things that move us along; negative: things that get in our way).<br /><br />Do you want to support his channel?<br /><br />Please go to his website located in the link below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate/">https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate/</a><br /><br />If you would like to support my channel<br />Please go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribestar.com/thearchangel911">https://www.subscribestar.com/thearchangel911</a><br /><br />Thank you for all your support.
