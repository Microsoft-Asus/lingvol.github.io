ask your boyfriend, dad, male friend or brother to join!! This is (obviously) super suitable for men as well! ♥︎ / Werbung<br /><br />Let's welcome back our special guest @Joel Corry  from the UK... and his amazing music!<br />If we look closely we can see him struggling :D I made this muscular, super fit, strong hulk STRUGGLEEEEEE haha!! <br />I admit, holding those muscles up during the last couple of exercises must be harder than holding up spaghetti arms. <br /><br />When he sent me the mix of his music, I felt like it's so motivating and quick.. I HAD TO create an advanced and challenging workout! <br />This routine combines advanced core exercises with upper body movements. So we train arms, shoulders, chest &amp; our entire core ♥︎<br /><br />▸  I burned 75kcal in those 10min. <br />Depending on your height, weight &amp; fitness level, the burned calories may vary between 65 - 110kcal! <br />_<br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever we are doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! I also recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. <br /><br />▸ you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
