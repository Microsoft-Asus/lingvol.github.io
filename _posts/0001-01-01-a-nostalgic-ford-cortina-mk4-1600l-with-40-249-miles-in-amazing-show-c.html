Having acquired this Cortina in 2017, KGF Classic Cars were delighted to see that the car still wore its factory fitted panels which were unrepaired and incredibly well preserved.  Linear shut lines and defined panel edges affirmed the amazing originality, and first paint had been retained.   The decision was made to commission an expensive professional glass out repaint, returning the car to its former glory.  Meticulous removal and either replacement or refurbishment of trim sections was a real labour of love, and the remit quickly became clear, to make this Cortina exceptional regardless of time.  The preservation of some original aged trim pieces took preference over aftermarket replacements, and with this in mind some very minor markings can be seen upon close scrutiny.  All factory glass and lights are number plate etched, with exception of the front screen which was replaced due to a stone chip.  A new lease of life for this already remarkable Cortina, ready now for many more years of cherishment.<br /><br />INTERIOR<br />Having covered just 40,249 miles from new, the original interior has been well preserved.  The factory coverings to the Black Fabric seats, (Code A1), are clean and show only minimal wear.  Three tiny nicks to the fabric along to rear seat top can be seen.  The colour keyed carpets, matching door cards and perforated headlining are in good condition.  All switchgear and functions are in excellent order and housed in a perfect dashboard with no cracks or sun related distortion.  A wonderfully original classic Ford interior, comfortable and hugely nostalgic.<br /><br />ENGINE &amp; TRANSMISSION<br />Ford’s time tested and trustworthy 1600 OHC unit with single choke carburettor needs little introduction.  With a power output of 72bhp, a top speed of 94mph and a 0-60 time of 13 seconds is quoted.  Bonnet up exhibiting is a must with factory plates displayed along with beautifully detailed components and original panel fitment.  The four speed all synchromesh manual gearbox feels light with a positive clutch action and relaxed motoring is effortless.<br /><br />WHEELS, TYRES &amp; BRAKES<br />The original styled steel wheels with 13 x 4.5in rims are in immaculate order and shod in matching 165/80 R13 tyres with plenty of tread remaining.  The spare wheel is housed alongside the original jack in a spotless boot area, still protected by the boot mat and totally original with factory weld seams still visible.  Hydraulic dual line brakes with servo assistance and 9.75in front discs offer ample stopping power and complete assurance.<br /><br />HISTORY FILE<br />First registered on 1st August 1979, this rare surviving Ford Cortina has covered a very low and verified 40,249 miles from new.  Previous MOT certificates dating back to 1983 and a large collection of invoices date from 1980 to 2017 track the mileage and form part of the comprehensive history file.  Perusal of which leaves in no doubt the fastidious maintenance this car has enjoyed which is testament for the superb mechanical performance.  Recent work carried out in 2016 includes a major service and new carburettor.  The previous keeper, Mr Holmes, a member of the Ford Cortina Owners Club and huge classic car enthusiast sold the Cortina to KGF Classic Cars early in 2017 after purchasing our Rover Montego 1.6LX.  Mr Holmes even kept a maintenance log for the car!  All original handbooks, operating guides and the Ford Accessories booklet remain with the car.  KGF Classic Cars quickly learned of the amazing originality of this Cortina with only the factory first paint showing cosmetic aging.  The car was handed to renowned and trusted Classic Cars Restorer, Andrew Skervin, to carry out the full glass out repaint, the results of which are a credit to both him and the car.  A truly stunning classic Ford.<br /><br />MOT November 2018, HPI Clear.
