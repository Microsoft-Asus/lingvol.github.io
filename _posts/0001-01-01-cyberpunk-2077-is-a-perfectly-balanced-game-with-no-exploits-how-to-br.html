{% raw %}Welcome to the world of Cyberpunk 2077! It Is one day away from the games release and I have been given early access to find as many exploits and bugs in cyberpunk as possible! Now because the embargo on content is lifting only 1 hour after I got access I decided it would be great to live stream my hunt for exploits and bugs inside this video game!  So today the spiffing brit is on a mission to see if cd projekt reds new game is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if my wonderful guide of how to break cyberpunk 2077 live might hint that this game is not perfectly balanced!<br /><br />What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. <br /><br />Magestic Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit">https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing">https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing</a><br />Twitter: @thespiffingbrit<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/spiffing">https://discord.gg/spiffing</a><br /><br />Title: Cyberpunk 2077 IS A PERFECTLY BALANCED GAME WITH NO EXPLOITS - How to Break Cyberpunk 2077 Live<br /><br />#Exploit #Cyberpunk #Live{% endraw %}
