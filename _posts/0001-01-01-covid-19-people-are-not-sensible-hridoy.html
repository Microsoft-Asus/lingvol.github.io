The virus can spread from infected animals but human-to-human transmission is also possible. It spreads like any other respiratory disease, through contaminated air-droplets that come out of the mouth of infected persons when talking, coughing or sneezing. The virus can survive in the environment from a few hours to a few days (depending on surfaces and environmental conditions) and touching affected surfaces and then the mouth or nose is thought to be the way of transmission. The virus is killed in the environment with alcohol-based solutions.<br /><br />#covid_19 #people_are_not_sensible #hridoy
