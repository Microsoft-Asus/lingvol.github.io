Osho who are you?  <br />Osho replies, and says that to find yourself you must lose yourself.<br /><br />&quot;My invitation is to make you aflame, and unless you know a life which is luminous and aflame all your knowledge is just a deception. You are gathering it to help you forget that the real knowledge is missing. But however great is your accumulation of the other, the objective, the world, it is not going to become a substitute for your self-knowing. With self-knowing suddenly all darkness disappears, and all separation from existence.<br />I am an invitation to take a courageous jump into the ocean of Life&quot;<br /><br /><br />Enjoy the OSHO Experience yourself at the OSHO International Meditation Resort: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.osho.com/visit">https://www.osho.com/visit</a><br /><br />You can participate in a full program of:<br /><br />OSHO Meditations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.osho.com/meditate">https://www.osho.com/meditate</a><br /><br />OSHO Active Meditations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.osho.com/meditate/active-meditations/why-active-meditations">https://www.osho.com/meditate/active-meditations/why-active-meditations</a><br /><br />OSHO Multiversity Programs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.osho.com/learn">https://www.osho.com/learn</a><br /><br />Chose playlist in your own language: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/oshointernational/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/oshointernational/playlists</a><br /><br />Would you like to join the OSHO Video Translation Project?  –<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.oshotalks.com/">http://www.oshotalks.com/</a><br /><br />© OSHO International Foundation.<br /><br />® OSHO is a registered trademark of OSHO International Foundation.
