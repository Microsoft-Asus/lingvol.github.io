{% raw %}Everyone welcome Blue to the Wiz! He's very nervous around new people and sometimes dogs. Some of his favorite behavioral issues are trash diving and incessant barking, which we'll be addressing by adding a better source of mental stimulation to help him become much calmer! LIKE to wish Blue good luck!!{% endraw %}
