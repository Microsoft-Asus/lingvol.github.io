We grew up listening to certain theories that were believed to be true but over the years we have learnt how wrong our assumptions were. If we look at it like an advancement instead of a subject for mockery, we have a great deal of data to reflect upon and learn from it. So are you ready go back in time to laugh at our inaccuracies and celebrate the spirit of science?<br /><br />Number 10. Goldfish has a memory span of 3 seconds<br />Number 9. Telegony<br />Number 8.
