Someone doesn’t understand my purpose I ain't fucking with. <br /><br />It's all love but I’m cutting em.<br /><br />100k streams, 4th release, they have faith I'm gonna make it out, please keep your faith didn’t have it then I don’t need it now.<br /><br />Telling me I do too much, I ain't got no time to chill.<br />Grill myself 'bout laying up like I’ve got the time to kill. <br />No one needs to tell me shit believe me I’m on my ass foreal. <br /><br />Asking for forgiveness, God have mercy for my sins, sometimes we do bad when we’re taking these risks. <br /><br />Focused on this flip, the next flip and the next flip, how can I be focused on the business and you’re talking drip?<br /><br />Bro told me he’s kicking lean and I'm so proud of him, <br />been through some pain, held some stains but his comeback is mountain big. <br /><br />What a time to be alive, make sure that you really live. <br />People think they’re living life, really they’re just dead inside. <br />Old age ain't a guarantee, beating odds ain't for the weak. <br /><br />Won together but I lost alone now we hardly speak. <br />I was giving out myself for free, giving out my time for cheap.<br />Accepted myself and I overcame anxiety, turns out I didn’t need you, turns out I just needed me. <br /><br />Make it mutual or you gotta go, cut off what doesn’t grow. <br /><br />Keep the love I don’t want it back, I’m too lit you can’t have me back, tell em that I’m done with that.<br /><br />Miss me wit' the bullshit, used to pray to be rich, older now I grind for it. <br />Nothing is a given gotta lace up &amp; go handle shit. <br /><br />Told Marj ima handle this, tell her go and take her pick, choose where you wanna live. <br /><br />Working for the bigger picture and starving all distractions, <br />should have seen the signs from the lack of satisfaction, <br />all of your reactions, boy you good at acting. <br /><br />Didn’t wanna see me triumph but I don’t blame you, now I can’t claim you. Look at what the game do, really made me and changed you. You folded I made a change too. <br /><br />Mind on overdrive and the pain I gotta play through. Negative vibes I won’t be slave to. You can ride the wave or let it take you.<br /><br />Relying on people they’ll remind you that they saved you. That's over and over, all this fake love it made me colder and colder. <br /><br />A film by: Duncan Lewis<br /><br />4WARDNEVABAKWARD
