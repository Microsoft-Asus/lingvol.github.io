Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna were among those who provided the ministry of Jesus with resources. Among Jesus followers were the poor and the wealthy and each gave of what they had. May we use our gifts and resources for the benefit of the Kingdom of God.<br /><br />Thank you for joining us today live from the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Downtown Los Angeles. We may be tuning in from locations far away, but we are together in prayer! #saferathome<br /><br />Today's Readings <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings">http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings</a>
