Verizon beats Visible in this comparison, but Visible may be better for you if you care about cheap prices and good coverage. Verizon is best if you want faster data, and more perks!<br /><br />🛑 🛑 🛑 <br />DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/WhistleOutYouTube">http://bit.ly/WhistleOutYouTube</a><br />We publish two videos each week, one is always on Friday the other is normally on Wednesday.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Visible_Cell">http://bit.ly/Visible_Cell</a><br />🛑 🛑 🛑 <br /><br />You’re deciding between Verizon and Visible Mobile, today i’m going to compare the two in a few different categories and see which Carrier comes out on top. The categories are <br />- Coverage (1:00)<br />- Internet speed (1:31)<br />- Plans (1:53)<br />- Pricing (2:15)<br />- Perks (2:42)<br /><br />After each category I'll award either carrier a Gold Star, the carrier at the end of the video with the most gold stars wins! <br /><br />Now before we jump in,  Visible is owned by, and operates on, Verizon’s towers and network. Even though Visible and Verizon are almost the same there are some key differences which I'll be going over in our category comparison. Our first category is Coverage.<br /><br />COVERAGE - TIE<br />Now because Verizon and Visible run on the same network, their coverage is the same. Of the big four carriers Verizon has the most nationwide coverage. So if coverage is what you’re after, you can’t go wrong with either carrier. Because of that, we’re calling this one a tie and giving each carrier a Gold Star. Next up is internet and data speeds.<br /><br />DATA SPEEDS - VERIZON<br />Because Visible and Verizon are on the same network, generally speaking the internet speeds will be the same HOWEVER when there is congestion on Verizon’s network, Visible customers may get throttled which would slow down your internet speeds temporarily. Because of that, we’re giving Verizon the gold star, although it is a close call. Next up… Plans!<br /><br />PLANS - VERIZON<br />Off the bat Verizon has more plans to choose from, hands down, so we’re giving them gold star. Visible has one plan that is hard to beat, but if you want variety, Visible isn’t your guy. Next up, Pricing!<br /><br />PRICE - VISIBLE<br />Technically Verizon does have cheaper plans than Visible but Visible's lone $40 unlimited plan absolutely blows Verizon’s unlimited plans out of the water. Verizon can’t really compare with their cheapest Unlimited plan starting at $65 a month. Because of that, we’re giving this gold star to Visible! Our last category is perks!<br /><br />PERKS - VERIZON<br />Visible and Verizon each have perks. Verizon offers free Disney+ for a year with all plans and free Apple Music with a select few more expensive plans Plus you get Verizon up which offers you weekly discounts on different brands and products and with some plans you get up to 500GB in cloud storage.<br /><br />Visible offers party pay which is similar to Verizon's family plans where you pay less for the more lines you add, but the difference is, Visible's party pay doesn't put you all on the same account. Which means you don't have to worry about covering the other lines if they don't pay<br /><br />Plus you get an unlimited hotspot, some Verizon plans also come with a hotspot but the speeds are throttled after you use up all high-speed data.  Because Verizon offers more in perks, we’re giving them the Gold Star.<br /><br />FINAL TALLY - VERIZON 4 | VISIBLE 2<br />After 5 categories Verizon has come out on top with 4 wins in coverage, data/internet speeds, Plans, and perks! Visible had 2 wins in coverage and price.<br /><br />Just because Verizon won here doesn’t mean they are best for you… For instance you should choose Verizon if you want to spend a little more money to avoid throttling, you want more plan options, and free Disney+ and Apple Music. <br /><br />You should choose Visible if you want an inexpensive unlimited plan that includes an unlimited hotspot, Wi-Fi calling, and all the same coverage and internet speeds as their name brand parent. Visible also won the WhistleOut Award for the BEST Unlimited Prepaid Provider, so we highly recommend their service. <br /><br />Let me know in the comments who you would choose: Verizon or Visible??<br /><br />👉🏽 WhistleOut.com is a cell phone plan and broadband plan comparison website.
