{% raw %}Telepathy Is Easier Than You Think<br />New videos DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bigth.ink/youtube">https://bigth.ink/youtube</a><br />Join Big Think Edge for exclusive videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bigth.ink/Edge">https://bigth.ink/Edge</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Some have proposed using quantum entanglement (the invisible umbilical cord that exists between objects) as a form of telepathy. But there are much more practical ways of achieving telepathy that already exist.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />MICHIO KAKU:<br /><br />Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study as well as New York University (NYU).<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />TRANSCRIPT:<br /><br />Michio Kaku: Personally, I think that there are easier ways of telepathy than using quantum entanglement.  Already we can take MRI scans, EEG scans of the brain, decipher them using computers, shoot that information to another person.  This is called radio-enhanced telepathy.  <br /><br />Using quantum entanglement to do that is quite complicated because of the problem of de-coherence.  Objects that vibrate in phase when you separate them are also coherent.  There‚Äôs an umbilical cord that emerges between two objects.  That‚Äôs called quantum entanglement.  However, we consist of trillions upon trillions of atoms, so to get two minds to vibrate in unison like that would be impossible.  The world‚Äôs record for making objects entangled is only just a few atoms.  Imagine trying to entangle two minds together. <br /><br />So it sounds like a neat idea, putting quantum entanglement with telepathy, but hey, let‚Äôs be real: there is an easier way to do it, and that‚Äôs using computers and radio.<br /><br />Directed / Produced by<br />Jonathan Fowler &amp; Elizabeth Rodd<br /><br />For more info please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bigthink.com/videos/telepathy-is-easier-than-you-think-2">https://bigthink.com/videos/telepathy-is-easier-than-you-think-2</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />ABOUT BIG THINK:<br /><br />Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢<br />Big Think is the leading source of expert-driven, actionable, educational content -- with thousands of videos, featuring experts ranging from Bill Clinton to Bill Nye, we help you get smarter, faster.
