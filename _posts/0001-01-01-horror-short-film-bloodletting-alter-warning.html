Dana sits in a bath, her expression pained. She is soaking in her own blood. Her period is back.<br /> <br />Dana is at a women’s retreat by the sea, but the group’s new age perspective doesn’t sit well with her. She rejects the leader Temme’s offer of cloth menstrual pads, preferring tampons for their disposability. She rejects Temme’s company, unwilling to let any vulnerability show. But the worries bubbling beneath the surface of Dana’s mind soon boil over.<br /> <br />During a group meditation, memories come back to Dana. Heavy breathing, hearts beating, water rushing, and a cry. Back at the house, Dana reaches to pull out her tampon, but finds there is more inside of her than just cotton and blood. It cannot just be ripped from her body and discarded. It cannot be forgotten. And it cannot be dealt with alone.<br /><br />Dana - Claire Sara<br />Temme - Marie Werrett<br />Director - Katia Mancuso<br />Writer - Katherine Cavanagh<br />Producer - Katherine Cavanagh &amp; Dylan Harris<br />Director of Photography - Felicia Smith<br />Script Supervisor - Beth Gleeson<br />Sound Recordist - James Browning<br />Gaffer - Justin Yong<br />Makeup/Prosthetics Artist - Stephanie Elkington<br />Editor - Dylan Harris<br />Composer - Louis Stevens<br />Sound Design &amp; Sound Mix - Bianca Molini, Patrick Barraclough, Jeremy Tang<br />Stills Photographer - Rebecca-Marian Irene<br /><br />About ALTER:<br />The most provocative minds in horror bring you three new short films every week exploring the human condition through warped and uncanny perspectives. <br /> <br />Be ready to leave the world you know behind and subscribe.
