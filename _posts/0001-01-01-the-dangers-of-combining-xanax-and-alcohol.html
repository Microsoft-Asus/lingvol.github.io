Xanax is a benzodiazepine that's used for anxiety and often prescribed around the country for young adults. It's very easy for people to get Xanax from their doctors. When used as prescribed, Xanax is a very safe medication. However, it can be lethal when mixed with alcohol. <br /><br />When somebody takes a bar of Xanax and has a drink, one plus one does not equal two. One plus one actually equals three or four. And some of these kids that are inexperienced with their benzodiazepine use will take several bars of Xanax and drink. Sometimes they donâ€™t wake up. So, the message today is: if you have a loved one, particularly a young adult, that suffers from anxiety and is on a benzodiazepine, they could be at risk due to their access to alcohol. Any alcohol is dangerous but particularly the binge drinking that goes on in colleges could put them at risk for death.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />CONNECT WITH US:<br /><br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mtsi.de/treatment">https://mtsi.de/treatment</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/mountainsidetreatment">http://www.facebook.com/mountainsidetreatment</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/mountainsidect">http://www.instagram.com/mountainsidect</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/mountainside">http://www.twitter.com/mountainside</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/mountainside-treatment-center">http://www.linkedin.com/company/mountainside-treatment-center</a>
