She, like the rest of her family, likes to get certain things changed, and that is okay. <br /><br />Kourtney is a naturally beautiful woman with a gorgeous wide smile that lights up her whole face. Along with the wide smile, is her large expressive eyes, and thick, long, lush hair. To see how she got to where she is now, we will dive back in time to 2010 when the changes started. <br /><br />I will not list everything here, because it is in the video, but you will be thoroughly surprised. I will cover all the rumors of the possible surgeries people have said she has had and give my opinion one by one. The surgeries will be on her Eyes, Neck, Nose, jaw, and more. I even talk about how she has dabbled with C02 Fractional lasers. #poosh #lorryhill #KUWTK<br /><br />A little about Kourtney Kardashian:<br />Kourtney is sister number 1 of the 3 kardashian sisters.
