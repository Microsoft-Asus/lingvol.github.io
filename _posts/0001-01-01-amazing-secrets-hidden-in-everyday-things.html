When we eat, when we work, when we entertain ourselves, we always make use of these tools to facilitate whatever it is that we want to get done. But how well do we know these things? Are we aware of all of their features? Or maybe there are some secrets about these things that we don’t know about yet. Today we’ll be looking at “Amazing Secrets Hidden in Everyday Things.” Embrace yourself for a video packed with secrets that I’m sure you didn’t know about. I promise you that by the time we make it to the top you’ll have learned a thing or two about stuff that you probably interact with in your everyday life.<br /><br />Flavored Nintendo Cartridges<br /><br />Have you ever put a Nintendo Switch cartridge inside your mouth? I hope not! Unless, of course, you’re a toddler who still doesn’t fully understand the difference between edible and non-edible items. But for that reason, nintendo has put a bitter taste in their cartridges. Since these things are so small, and likely to be messed with by little ones who don’t fully know what they’re doing, Nintendo made them taste bitter, so people can spit it out and keep themselves from swallowing them. Quite smart isn’t it? I guess you’ll know about that taste if you already put one of them in your mouth. But if you haven’t, please don’t try it! <br /><br />Bread Tags<br /><br />This one is quite obvious isn’t it? Well, that’s what you think. But bread tags have more than just one function. Besides being used to help you keep your bread fresh and sealed, these little tags also indicate the day on which your bread was baked. For example, if the tag is blue, it means it was baked on a Monday, and if it’s green it was baked on a Tuesday. And then Red is for Thursdays, White is for Fridays and Yellow is for Saturdays! This is quite convenient and once you learn the color codes, you will easily remember how fresh your bread is. So make sure you eat it before it goes stale. <br /><br />Holes in Pen Caps<br /><br />If you use pens, you’ve probably used their caps to make funny whistles and other funny sounds with it. But there’s more to these holes in the caps than just making musical instruments out of them. Just like the Nintendo Cartridges, these holes have been put there to help people who put small objects in their mouths. There were studies that showed that a lot of people choke on pen caps, so these holes were put there to make sure that people can keep breathing while help arrives. I still think it would be best if no one ever chokes on one of these things. But I guess it’s good to know that there’s a bit of hope if such tragedy occurs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Colors at the Bottom of Toothpaste Tubes<br /><br />If you’re a curious person, you’ve probably noticed that the bottom of the toothpaste tubes usually have a square that is either red, black or blue. And if you haven’t noticed that, you should go find your toothpaste right now and check what’s at the bottom of the tube. These colors are not just random; they’ve been put there to let you know what kind of substance has been used to make your toothpaste. If it’s blue, it means it was made with natural elements and some medicine to enhance its effects. If it’s green, it means it only has natural ingredients. And then, if it’s red it has a chemical composition added to the natural ingredients. And if it’s black, then it means it’s pure chemical. So there you go, now you can be a bit more aware of what kind of toothpaste you want to buy, without having to read an endless list of ingredients.<br /><br />Soda Cup Lids<br /><br />When you come home to a clean and neat table, the last thing you want to do is probably leave a soda ring on it. For that reason, soda cup lids have been designed in a way that you can also use them as coasters. The lid has a grooved ring on which the bottom of your soda cup will perfectly fit. Of course, the last thing we want to do is produce more plastic in this world, but don’t worry about that! Even the biodegradable lids have this feature - so give some good use to it and don’t leave any more marks on your tables. <br /><br />That Extra Little Pocket on Your Jeans<br /><br />We all have given different uses to that little pocket on our jeans. In my case
