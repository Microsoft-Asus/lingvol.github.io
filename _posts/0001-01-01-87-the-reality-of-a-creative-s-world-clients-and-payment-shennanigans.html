Creatives and clients. We all know the many downsides and uphill battles the many things that creative faces when it comes to a client project. Payments, demands, disagreements... it's all part and parcel of being a creative. In this episode, we got Kim who is a creative designer and illustrator herself to share with us what went down with her recent client job. Together with Ming Han and Melissa Campbell, we sat them down together to talk about the many red flags for creatives, what should aspiring creatives do and what to do when it comes to payment between clients.
