The CarCaddy Vehicle Puller is designed for automotive and truck repair shops, car dealers, auto body shops, manufacturers, auto museums, auctions and government highway service organizations.<br /><br />The most common applications that need a CarCaddy Vehicle Puller is the pulling of a stalled or non-operable vehicle in and out of a service center, the moving of a vehicle on a dealership show room floor or an auction house or museum, or at the end of an auto production line. The unit’s power, size, maneuverability, and price tag make it an extremely attractive solution compared to alternative methods of moving wheeled vehicles in tight and confined areas.<br /><br />The CarCaddy Vehicle Puller has many unique features over other methods to relocate vehicles including its hydraulic roller rams that effortlessly pull any two wheels of a vehicle up a ramp, off the ground, so the powered CarCaddyVP tug can easily and safely turn and maneuver the vehicle without the wheels of the vehicle moving. This operation eliminates the cumbersome straps, hooks, and brackets needed to lift and pull a vehicle, or the “bumping” of the vehicle from behind with rubber push pads.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jmcautomotiveequipment.com/carcaddyvp-motorized-vehicle-puller/">http://jmcautomotiveequipment.com/carcaddyvp-motorized-vehicle-puller/</a>
