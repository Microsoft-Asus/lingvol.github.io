Given Studio Orange's reputation, I don't think the title is that controversial, but I still wanted to dive into what I think Beastars does so well and how CG lends its strengths to those elements and ultimately makes for an incredible story and show. Of course, we have no idea what a 2D adaptation would have looked like, but I think it would be hard to compete with what we got. But let me know your thoughts and enjoy! <br /><br />Previous CG Video - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ryA_4ScplXM">https://youtu.be/ryA_4ScplXM</a><br /><br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br />TazerLad Tees: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sJWMpM">https://bit.ly/2sJWMpM</a><br />Designed by the Awesome Pungoro.
