In this episode of The Real Build, I got to talk with David Belman, owner of Belman Homes in Waukesha, Wisconsin.  David worked in many phases of construction before becoming a new construction salesperson, then owning his real estate, land development, &amp; home building companies. He has a passion for building homes, giving back to the community through Operation Finally Home, and being an industry leader for housing.   He served as President of the Metropolitan Builders Association &amp; President of the Wisconsin Builders Association. <br /><br />David is an industry panelist for housing &amp; real estate summits in Wisconsin. He publishes articles for Milwaukee Magazine and is a guest speaker for home building and sales at WCTC.<br /><br />His company, Belman Homes, was the first builder in Wisconsin to build a free home for a wounded war hero with Operation Finally Home. He founded the Motivational Minute video series providing real-life sales, motivation, and personal growth information in under a minute on LinkedIn. (#MotivationalMinute). David has a Podcast, the Home Building Hero Podcast, in which he provides housing industry news. <br /><br />David and I discussed a variety of different topics about the building industry. Most importantly, we talked about how the best approach in building isn't to sell your customers just on price.  It's essential to sell yourself on the customer experience and quality.  We discussed how valuable customer experience is during every build, and as builders, if we focus on the overall experience versus other things, we are going to over-deliver.<br /><br />David Belman: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbelman/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbelman/</a><br /><br />Website: belmanhomes.com/  <br /><br />Follow me  Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/imbillreiman/.">https://www.instagram.com/imbillreiman/.</a> <br /><br />Email: Bill@rkreiman.com  <br /><br />CONNECT WITH ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:  <br /><br />▶︎ YOUTUBE | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/QmTC7Z">https://goo.gl/QmTC7Z</a><br /><br />▶︎ INSTAGRAM | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/imbillreiman">https://www.instagram.com/imbillreiman</a><br /><br />▶︎FACEBOOK| <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/billy.reiman">https://www.facebook.com/billy.reiman</a><br /><br />▶︎ LINKEDIN | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-reim...">https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-reim...</a> <br /><br />▶︎ TWITTER | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ImBillReiman">https://twitter.com/ImBillReiman</a><br /><br />▶︎ WEBSITE | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rkreiman.com">https://www.rkreiman.com</a>
