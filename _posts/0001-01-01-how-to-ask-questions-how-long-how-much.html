My name is Emma, and in today's video I am going to teach you a very, very important grammar point. I'm going to teach you about a mistake many, many students make. So I don't want you to make this mistake, so let's get started. In this video I am going to teach you the difference between &quot;How long&quot;, &quot;How long time&quot;, &quot;How much time&quot; and &quot;How many times&quot;. Students often confuse these four expressions. So let's look at some of the differences.<br /><br />So I have here a question. I actually have three different sentences, here. One of them is right, two of them are wrong. Okay? So let's look at these together. The first one: &quot;How long time have you been here?&quot; The second one: &quot;How long have you been here?&quot; And the third one: &quot;How many time have you been here?&quot; So one of these is correct. Which one do you think is right? If you said: &quot;How long time have you been here?&quot; that's incorrect. This one, it's wrong. Number two: &quot;How long have you been here?&quot; If you said this one, you are correct.  This is right. What about the last one? &quot;How many time have you been here?&quot; This one is also wrong, but we can make it right if we add an &quot;s&quot;. So let's go over each of these so you can find out why some of these are wrong, and why some of them are right.<br /><br />To get started, let's look at &quot;How long&quot;. So when we ask somebody: &quot;How long...?&quot; we are asking them about time. Okay? We want to know the amount of time for something. So, for example: &quot;How long have you been here?&quot; I want to know, maybe, how many minutes. Or maybe I want to know how many hours you've been here. Okay? If I ask you: &quot;How long have you lived in England?&quot; an answer would be a number that has to do with time. You might say: &quot;Five years.&quot;, &quot;Four weeks.&quot;, &quot;Two months.&quot; Okay? So when we ask: &quot;How long...?&quot; the answer and what we want to know is about time; minutes, hours, days, months, weeks, years. Okay?<br /><br />So let's look at another example. &quot;How long have you lived in Spain?&quot; The answer is going to be something about time. &quot;Three years.&quot; Okay? You'll notice not always, but many times we use: &quot;How long&quot; with the present perfect. It's possible to use it with the past tense, the simple past, and also the future, but you will often see it with the present perfect. &quot;How long have you been married?&quot;, &quot;How long have you worked here?&quot;, &quot;How long have you studied English?&quot; Okay? So a lot of the questions you probably want to ask somebody, you're probably going to use: &quot;How long have you...?&quot; Okay? Very common way we ask questions.<br /><br />So, what about: &quot;How long time&quot;? Can I say that also? Can I say: &quot;How long time have you lived in Spain?&quot; or: &quot;How long time did you sleep on the plane?&quot; No. If you're asking how long, you don't need the word &quot;time&quot;. Okay? We never say in English: &quot;How long time&quot;. Many students say: &quot;How long time&quot;, but this is not correct. The correct expression: &quot;How long&quot;. Not: &quot;How long time&quot;. All right, so now let's look at &quot;How much time&quot; and &quot;How many times&quot;.<br /><br />Okay, so we've talked about &quot;How long&quot;, which is good, &quot;How long time&quot;, which is bad. Now let's look at: &quot;How much time...?&quot; I think this is why many students get confused. I think they confuse: &quot;How long&quot; and &quot;How much time&quot;, and they... As a result, they create: &quot;How long time&quot;, which is incorrect.<br /><br />So: &quot;How much time&quot; actually is pretty much the same as &quot;How long&quot;. When you ask: &quot;How much time...?&quot; you want to know about the amount of time. You want to know about maybe it's minutes, days, weeks, months, years. It's the same as &quot;How long&quot;. Okay? So, for example: &quot;How much time does it take to get to work?&quot; I could also say: &quot;How long does it take to get to work?&quot; They have the same meaning. Or: &quot;How much time have you waited?&quot;, &quot;How much time have you been in line for?&quot; Okay? So, the answers to these questions are going to be about time. -&quot;How much time does it take to get to work?&quot; -&quot;For me, it takes one hour.&quot; -&quot;How much time have you waited in line?&quot; -&quot;I've waited in line five minutes.&quot; Okay? So, for both &quot;How long&quot; and &quot;How much time&quot;, they're pretty much the same. In conversation, we usually use &quot;How long&quot;. Okay? You can use both, but native speakers are more likely to use &quot;How long&quot;. So if you're trying to decide: Do I use &quot;How much time&quot; or &quot;How long&quot;? &quot;How long&quot; is more natural and it's more common. Okay? But they mean the same thing.
