Is Reciting Quran With Tajweed Obligatory? Is Tajweed Obligatory In Adhan? Tajweed vs Tarteel<br /><br />In this youtube video, I ask Ustaath Muhammad Yahya whether Tajweed is obligatory when reciting the Quran.  We also discuss the application of tajweed, or the lack of, in the call to prayer (Adhan).  We end the discussion with explaining the purpose of HealMyTajweed with exciting news from this platform moving forwards. <br /><br />Time Stamps:<br /><br />00:22 Top 15 Tips | How To Memorise The Entire Quran | Hifz | Hifdh | Best Advice To Parents And Children<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6OWbTSpE0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6OWbTSpE0</a><br /><br />01:30 Never Learn Tajweed Rules Of The Quran In A Short Course Only | Do This Instead<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBF99s2lxj4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBF99s2lxj4</a><br /><br />02:40 Articulation Points Of Arabic Letters In Tajweed | General Makhaarij AL Huroof | 28 Or 29 Letters<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW_tMiNQ7UA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW_tMiNQ7UA</a><br /><br />03:30 Articulation Points Of Arabic Letters In Tajweed | Specific Makhraarij Al Huroof | 28 Or 29 Letters<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DT_ozQnT6Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DT_ozQnT6Q</a><br /><br />04:35 How To Assess Any Quran Tajweed Student | Best Sincere Advice To Madrassah Teachers &amp; Students<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H32cFu8N8_w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H32cFu8N8_w</a><br /><br />How To Improve Your Quran Recitation? In these Tajweed Lessons for Beginners, we teach you how to correct your recitation of the quran by teaching you one tajweed rule at a time, a we go in a structured order of Juz Amma by learning and implementing only one tajweed rule per lesson.<br /><br />This is a unique approach to learning tajweed rules of the Quran.  Our aim is to teach you enough rules to learn Juz Amma with Tajweed, and in this unique free course you will be able to correct Surah Al Fateha, and from Surah An Nas to Surah Al Falaq with all the tajweed rules.<br /><br />By no means is this a replacement for a good teacher who needs to correct your recitation, and this is also not a full in depth course to teach accurate makhraj and sifaat (articulation point and characteristic) of each arabic alphabet or letter, for this we will have another course Insha Allah.<br /><br />Support us by joining the course, like and share this video, and subscribe to our channel.
