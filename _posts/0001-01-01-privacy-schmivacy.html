Oh please like these two can ever say they want privacy again when we are drip fed nearly daily of what they are doing, what they are eating, where they are going, who they are with etc.<br /><br />I think that perhaps they are not getting the attention they thought they would so are now trying to get attention.<br /><br />I wonder when we will find out what they are having for Christmas dinner, surely it couldnâ€™t be roast chicken.<br /><br /><br />Taz xx
