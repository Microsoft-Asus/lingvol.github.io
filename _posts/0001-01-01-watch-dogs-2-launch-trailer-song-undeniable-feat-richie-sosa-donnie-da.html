Watch Dogs 2 Launch trailer song &quot;Undeniable (feat. Richie Sosa) - Donnie Daydream&quot; WD2 OST<br /><br />Lyrics: The majority of the blow wouldn’t last five minutes in my size 10s<br />And even less time looking through my eye lens<br />I started out with like 20, I’m down to five friends<br />Started out with a penny, gunned it for five cents<br />Started out with the henny and then the kush came<br />Last time I freaked out and ain’t been high since<br />I’m on the fence shorty trying to send her rents<br />But how I’m gonna get top when I ain’t even got tints<br />And she don’t gotta lose her top, she don’t even got tits<br />So I’m praying that this creepy bus driver don’t glimpse<br />I’m rollin’<br />You would think my whip was stolen<br />In my past life I picked all that cotton in your clothing<br />I’m swollen like I hit a beehive with a Boeing<br />737 with my arms to the heavens like<br />Drop zone till the block’s gone<br />Can’t you tell we ran up out of options?<br /><br />This ain’t a choir group<br />Tell the entire troop<br />And let it set you free we undeniable<br /><br />[Chorus 1]<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br /><br />[Verse 2: Donnie Daydream]<br />Is anybody home?<br />Am I missing some info that I should probably know?<br />Did I overlook a memo that I should’ve read?<br />Are you saying I should let my secretary go?<br />For not letting me know?<br />That you’re claiming rank<br />Over the G-O-D without a plate of thanks<br />Paved the way like an I-talian laying bricks<br /><br />Why wild out<br />When I can lay and sit<br />I’ve been way legit<br />And not the opposite<br />Did crime did time didn’t drop a lick<br />Did yours did mine didn’t drop my dick<br />Did wars did dimes never flopped a bit<br />Hard drive no floppy disk<br />Parkside getting’ sloppy tip<br />Dark side call me bobby rich<br />I probably chew on steak and angulo swinging my hockey stick<br /><br />This ain’t a choir group<br />Tell the entire troop<br />And let it set you free we undeniable<br /><br />[Chorus 2]<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br /><br />[Verse 3: Donnie Daydream]<br />Science couldn’t save you from the holiest<br />The more spiritual couldn’t factor erroneous<br />Inside your brain mosaics hits its cracked with linoleum<br /><br />Where dreams go to die, terror prey on the loneliest<br />Only if every day was a piece of cake<br />The man sweeping in the kitchen wouldn’t need a break<br />The lady wiping down the plates wouldn’t need a smoke<br />The shorty on Facebook wouldn’t need a poke<br />She’s got daddy issues looking like she need a coat<br />Draped around her shoulders as you guide her to the freedom boat<br />All aboard<br />And I heard her friends preach twice<br />Hard dick and some dentine ice<br />Is all she should get<br />As he shouted at me from the balcony<br />Gin dripping off his chin as he looked around and he knows<br />Niggas be rolling you know I got a mouth on me<br />Like Mr.Potatohead but without the feet<br /><br />This ain’t a choir group<br />Tell the entire troop<br />And let it set you free we undeniable<br /><br />[Chorus 3]<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br />We undeniable<br /><br />Undeniable (feat.
