In this video I will give you a breakdown of three stopping techniques on inline skates / rollerblades that I think are suitable for the beginner skater to learn. Or indeed any level of skater if you have not tried them before.<br /><br />These are what I refer to as the drag stop, the basic powerstop and the powerslide.<br /><br />These are the three techniques I taught myself when I started skating three years ago and these breakdowns are how I learnt them.  It is not very long ago that I was still learning so I can remember what it was like trying to stop and some of the problems I had. I hope this tutorial will help you out!<br /><br />Please note though I am not a skate instructor.  These are just my ideas on how to learn but I hope you find them useful.<br /><br />This is not the definitive guide on how you must stop!  There are lots of different techniques and variations out there.  I would always encourage people to check out other guides and tutorials, whether that is here on Youtube or with your local skate instructor.<br /><br />Note: Sometimes these stops are called different names, for example the drag stop is also called the L stop and T stop.  And the powerstop and powerslide are sometimes inter changeable. Confusing I know!<br /><br />If you have any questions leave them in the comments and as always I will do my best to answer them.<br /><br />Happy stopping!<br /><br />#inlineskating #rollerblading #stoponskates<br /><br /><br /><br />The music used in this video is taken from the YouTube audio library and is therefore not subject to copy write.
