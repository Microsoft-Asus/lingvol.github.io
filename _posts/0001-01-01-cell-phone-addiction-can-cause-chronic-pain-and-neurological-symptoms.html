Among other issues, cell phone addiction and excessive hours of computer usage can create a structural problem in the neck and lead to cervical instability and vagus nerve degeneration. In our clinics, patients with chronic neck pain and headaches typically present with many other symptoms which Ross Hauser, MD discusses in this video. One thing that these massively increasing number of cases have in common is the countless amount of hours spent on the computer or looking down at a phone which have exacerbated their structural issue, often to a point that their condition has become completely debilitating.<br /><br />To learn more about cervical instability, Prolotherapy, or to have Dr. Hauser's team review your case, please reach out to us directly for help: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.caringmedical.com/conditions/prolotherapy-neck-pain-cervical-instability/#get-help-now">https://www.caringmedical.com/conditions/prolotherapy-neck-pain-cervical-instability/#get-help-now</a>  <br />You can also email directly at drhauser@caringmedical.com. <br />Or, call us at 239-308-4773 to speak with our team asap. <br /><br />Connect with us on social media: <br />Facebook (Main page): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CaringMedical/">https://www.facebook.com/CaringMedical/</a> <br />Hauser Neck Center/Caring Medical Florida Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stemcellprolotherapy/">https://www.facebook.com/stemcellprolotherapy/</a>   <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/caringmedic...">https://www.instagram.com/caringmedic...</a> <br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/caringmedical/">https://www.pinterest.com/caringmedical/</a> <br /><br />Thanks for watching.
