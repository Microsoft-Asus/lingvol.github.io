The secret lies in adjusting the shuttle first and doing the dangle test, as demonstrated on this video.  If the shuttle drops only very slightly (or even not at all) when you jolt it when it is dangling by the thread, this is the ideal tension, and you may not need to adjust the shuttle tension again - ever!  All the tension adjustments can then be made to the top thread.<br /><br />Manuals for old Singer machines can be downloaded from www.singerco.com.<br /><br />The machine shown on the video is a 1934 Singer 128K.  The method of adjusting the tension is the same for any make of vintage machine that has a long bobbin and shuttle.<br /><br />The decoration on the machine has the Indian Star, which has eight different Indian scripts in the points of the star.  The machine was manufactured in Scotland for export to India.
