Use your hands and your feet. You know it’s really neat to keep the<br />beat from your seat. Now clap your hands. Clap your hands. Clap your hands. Clap your<br />hands. Nod your head, shoulders flexed, listen well<br />what’s next. Now sway.<br />Replace clap your hands with stamp your<br />feet, slap your knees, snap your fingers, and<br />tap your toes.<br />From your seat get the beat.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation">http://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation</a>
