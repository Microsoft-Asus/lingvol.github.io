In this interview, she shares both her losses, and the miracle of divine love that allowed her to come out on the other side better than before.<br /><br />So many people are attached to the idea that they would just be happy if they found themselves in the right romantic relationship. But there's another kind of love that is the source and power of our lives. It is present with us all the time. <br /><br />Unfortunately, we are trained to look outside of ourselves for fulfillment and love. If you approach relationships with a feeling of neediness, you'll attract other needy people. Thatâ€™s not true love. <br /><br />Mary Morrissey advises us to learn to love ourselves so that we attract other people who love themselves too. Only by tapping into the divine love that is inside all of us (after all, something else created us) can we truly know ourselves and what weâ€™re capable of.<br /><br />The problem is that deep down, we don't really know who we are. So, how do we get in touch with this higher power? Well, one practice that Mary recommends is to foster a sense of gratitude for your life before you even get out of bed in the morning. If you can start your day with that high frequency, youâ€™ll be able to stay in that place of love.<br /><br />Divine love is always there. We just need to look inside and let it become part of our daily lives. If you can begin to build an internal relationship with the love you desire, as Mary Morrissey suggests, youâ€™ll live a happier, more fulfilled life.
