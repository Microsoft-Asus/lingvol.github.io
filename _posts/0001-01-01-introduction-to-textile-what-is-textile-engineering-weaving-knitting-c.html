The textiles can be defined as the products which are formed by the interlacement of fibers or yarn. The broad definition covers any product intermediate or final made in textile industry. Therefore, the term textile includes fibers, filaments, yarns, woven, knitted and braided cloths as well as nonwoven fabrics.<br /><br />What is Textile?<br />A textile product passes through several processes in its manufacturing before it becomes wearable. These processes include spinning, weaving, knitting, processing and garments manufacturing.<br /><br />Conventional Textiles:<br />Manufactured primarily for aesthetic or decorative purpose.<br />Fiber (natural or synthetic) is usually first Spun into Yarn and then Yarn is Woven / Knit into Fabric.<br /><br />Technical Textiles:<br />Manufactured primarily for performance or function rather than aesthetics.<br />May be both woven and non woven, and is made out of primarily synthetic and some natural fibers.{% endraw %}
