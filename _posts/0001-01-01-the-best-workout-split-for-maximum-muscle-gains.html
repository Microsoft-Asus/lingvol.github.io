Whether you are following a total body workout split or a bro split (or any variation of) you are going to want to watch this video.  Find out the best workout split for building maximum muscle gains and overall performance.  There is a key message that you will not want to miss when it comes to answering this question truthfully and without relying on simple studies to do so.<br /><br />When we talk about workout splits we are referring to the way that you break up your training over a period of time.  Generally, this is the amount of workouts that it takes to complete one cycle of training and that ensures that you are hitting all of the areas you are attempting to target in your workouts.  One of the most popular ways to split up workouts right now is actually one of the oldest in the books, and that is total body training.<br /><br />This refers to performing three total body workouts per week, generally on a Monday, Wednesday and a Friday with the remainder of the days either being reserved for conditioning or rest.  The benefits to this type of training are the higher focus on compound lifts that are designed to hit maximum muscle in each lift as well as the increased time for recovery.<br /><br />Additionally, as science would indicate, hitting a muscle (even with a lower daily volume) more frequently in a training cycle is one of the most effective ways to make it grow.  This would mean that if you were once following a more traditional bro split where you trained say chest just once per week with twelve to sixteen sets you would now be doing it as four to five sets per day over the three days in the week.<br /><br />The restimulation of the chest every 48 hours is sufficient to increase muscle protein synthesis without waiting too long to hit the muscle again (as would happen with a bro split - or at least a poorly planned one).  Does that mean that bro splits don’t work?  Not at all.  In fact, this is one of those instances of throwing the baby out with the bath water.  Nobody could argue that the single muscle group per day routine has been effective for some.  Maybe not as much as total body training, but there are many instances of it working well, and quite well to be exact.<br /><br />How can that be?  How can something that is somehow proven by science to be inferior actually produce results that in some cases are superior?  That is because the real best way to split your workout for maximum gains is to switch what you are doing when you can honestly answer that you have stopped making gains in either strength, size or both.  Just because something is supposed to be the best doesn’t mean that it is best for you at this time.  Changing your split may reveal to you that certain muscle groups of yours are more responsive on a different training cycle.<br /><br />The best you could do at that point is take the observations that you have made and use them to adapt your workout plan to idealize the volume and frequency that your body responds to the best.  This video is meant to open your eyes to that possibility.
