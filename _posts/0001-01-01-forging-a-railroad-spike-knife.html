{% raw %}Today in the shop I am getting a little bit of blacksmithing practice under my belt, by forging a knife out of an old railroad spike. Iâ€™ll take you through the process of  forging out the handle, drawing out the blade and forging in the bevels. Next I move to the grinders to grind in the final shape of the blade and then move on to the heat training process. After heat treatment I will go back to the grinder for finish work. This is a really fun project for beginner to master blacksmiths and knife makers who want to work on their forging skills.<br /><br />Congratulations to Cadence James, who will be receiving this forged railroad spike knife. His name was drawn from one of our first 10 Patreon supporters, who were all eligible to win this knife.<br /><br />To those of you who feel like you got something special from our videos and want to know how you can support us further, we have just launched our Patreon page here... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/theartofcraftsmanship">https://www.patreon.com/theartofcraftsmanship</a>{% endraw %}
