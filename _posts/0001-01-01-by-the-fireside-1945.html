You don't get much cosier than this fireside idyll, complete with crumpets, slippers and great-great-great grandmother's warming pan; so beguiling is the setting that the viewer will barely notice they are watching a commercial for Maypole Tea.<br /><br />All titles on the BFI Films channel are preserved in the vast collections of the BFI National Archive.
