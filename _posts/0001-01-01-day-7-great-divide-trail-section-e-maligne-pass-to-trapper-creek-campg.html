Great Divide Trail Section E (Saskatchewan River Crossing to Jasper)- Day 7.  We hiked ~25km from Maligne Pass to Trapper Creek campground on the Maligne River trail.  Parks Canada decomissioned the trail in 2012, so portions have deteriorated and become overgrown with willow.  If you're wearing pants, the hiking is still enjoyable and reasonably quick.  However, it would likely be more challenging in June/July due to river crossings and flooding.<br /><br />To start at the beginning of this unreal hike: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt6ZYgR4aXM&amp;list=PL4fbkIuDHKePr7Kx8hn3KhdxAQO-goRX2">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt6ZYgR4aXM&amp;list=PL4fbkIuDHKePr7Kx8hn3KhdxAQO-goRX2</a> <br />#GDT #JasperNationalPark #Jasper #CanadianRockies #hiking #backpacking #Alberta<br /><br />Gear used: <br />The Osprey Aether AG 70 held up well carrying 10 days of food (and I eat a lot!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.osprey.com/ca/en/product/aether-ag-70-AETHER70.html">https://www.osprey.com/ca/en/product/aether-ag-70-AETHER70.html</a><br />My new tent, the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2, was crazy light and survived some crazy mountain storms and snow: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bigagnes.com/Copper-Spur-HV-UL2-2020">https://www.bigagnes.com/Copper-Spur-HV-UL2-2020</a> <br />For filming, I used the GoPro Hero 7 and the Sony A6000: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero7-black/CHDHX-701-master.html">https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero7-black/CHDHX-701-master.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sony.ca/en/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit">https://www.sony.ca/en/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit</a>
