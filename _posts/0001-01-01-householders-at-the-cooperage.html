The wait is over! Come dance and celebrate the highly anticipated release of The Householders' second album, &quot;Stand Up&quot;. With backgrounds in jazz, house, hip-hop, electronica and devotional Indian music, The Householders have one foot firmly planted in the East while the other is most definitely kicking up a storm in the West, bringing the Deities to the Dancefloor.<br /><br />Expect to have fun, expect to move. The Householders bring a lot of heart and energy to encourage dance and devotion. You can expect a high energetic set filled with kirtan melodies, hiphop from the heart, and beats to make you move.
