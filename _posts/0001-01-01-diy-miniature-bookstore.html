As a kid, I used to like going to bookstores and spending a few hours there checking out and reading books. There were just many comfy couches provided but sometimes I sat on the floor together with others who were engrossed with the books on their hands. It's quite a nice feeling.<br /><br />Does anyone still do this? <br /><br />Hoping to post more videos soon!<br /><br />XOXO<br />Christine<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />SIMILAR PRODUCT LINK:<br />Robotime Miniature Bookstore <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sea.banggood.com/custlink/vDGDUnLS9a">https://sea.banggood.com/custlink/vDGDUnLS9a</a><br /><br />------------------------------------<br />GLUE USED:<br />Starbond Multi-Purpose Medium CA Glue<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.starbond.com/?rfsn=3277744.749083">https://www.starbond.com/?rfsn=3277744.749083</a><br /><br />White Glue<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />SONG CREDIT:<br />Rag Time Time by Doug Maxwell/Media Right Productions
