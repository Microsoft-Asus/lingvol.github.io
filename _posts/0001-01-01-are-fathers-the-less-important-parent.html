On Friday, November 8, 2019, Katy Faust--founder of #THEMBEFOREUS (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thembeforeus.com),">https://thembeforeus.com),</a> spoke at the University of Dallas on the issue of the rights of children to their own parents.  She asserts that the debate about parental rights--as important as they are--should take a secondary place to the rights of children to their own biological parents. <br /><br />The implications of her claim on issues of marriage and divorce, adoption, surrogacy, public policy, and other related matters are staggering.  Whether you agree or disagree with her argument and claim, her argument is coherent and sound and deserves to be heard and considered. <br /><br />A question and answer session followed the discussion.  The first question posed to Katy was her view on the idea that the father was the &quot;less important&quot; parent.  In response, Katy talked about the epidemic, destruction, and curse that fatherlessness inflicts on children and society.
