This cafe is great, and that cafe’s not worth visiting. This person is awesome, that person is annoying. <br /><br />Opinions are not absolute truths, it is merely what someone thinks. Yet whenever someone has a negative opinion about us, we find it so difficult to not take it personally. Even if our business has a 100 great reviews, the moment 1 bad review comes in… that’s all we can focus on. The one bad review bugs us or the rest of the day, or the week.<br /><br />It is almost part of our DNA to want to suffer, because even if there’s one tiny flaw in the an almost-perfect picture, we agonise over it. Even if we have a hundred friends who think we’re awesome, we feel the need to defend ourselves towards the one person who thinks we’re not. <br /><br />This is why when people say things about us, we get so affected. Some of us pretend to not care, but deep inside we wish the person harm, or we develop an intense dislike for them.<br /><br />If someone has a problem with you, the question to ask is, “Does what the person say have any validity?” “Did I behave in a rude, inconsiderate or annoying manner towards them, or is it simply the person’s opinion of me?”<br /><br />If we did do something that might offend someone, maybe it is a problem we do have, and we can try to be aware to not repeat the same behaviour again.  <br /><br />But if you are sure you did absolutely nothing, and they dislike you just for BEING you, then the person has a problem with you. It’s clearly their problem. If you take offense, get defensive or react in an angry manner, you're making their problem into your problem. And why would you want to do that?? <br /><br />If someone calls you stupid, you stop and examine if you really are stupid. If you've determined that you’re not, then it's just the person’s opinion, and their opinion is made up of what’s in their head, not made up of the truth. <br /><br />Everyone has an opinion about something, and there is absolutely no way that everyone’s going to have the same opinion about you. So live your life being awesome, let people think what they want, and just be happy, always. <br /><br />---
