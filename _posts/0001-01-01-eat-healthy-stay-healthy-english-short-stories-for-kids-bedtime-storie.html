The books they read and the characters they get to know can become like friends. It's also good for children to understand that books are a useful source of information and that good reading skills are important for success in their future lives.<br />Stories are a great way to introduce new words and ideas into a child’s language – starting with picture books for the very young, stories can help children learn about concepts such as shape, size, space and colour, up and down, inside and outside, numbers, the names of objects and Good Manners. They can also teach children about everyday tasks, such as how to brush their teeth, taking care of animals, cleaning and tidying and behaviour.<br />Stories are also useful for teaching more complex ideas, such as the importance of sharing, the passage of time, compassion for others. They can be useful when trying to explain traumatic events, such as family break-ups and bereavement. And what’s so great about learning through stories is that the process is done in a natural way. There’s no actual teaching involved at all, they learn from simple videos which are brought to you by Puntoons Kids the Video story Book.{% endraw %}
