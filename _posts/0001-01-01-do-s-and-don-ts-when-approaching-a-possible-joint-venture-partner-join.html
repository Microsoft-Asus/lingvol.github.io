The King of High-Ticket Sales, is one of the highest-paid and most respected consultants in the luxury and “high-ticket” space. <br /><br />Dan is the creator of High-Ticket Millions Methodology™, the world's most advanced system for getting high-end clients and commanding high fees with no resistance. <br /><br />Dan works exclusively with coaches, consultants, thought leaders and other service professionals who want a more sustainable, leveraged lifestyle and business through High-Ticket programs and Equity Income.<br /><br />Dan is one of the rare keynote speakers and business consultants that actually owns a portfolio of highly profitable business ventures. <br /><br />Not only he is a two times Tedx opening speaker, he's also an international best-selling author of over 12 books and the host of Shoulders of Titans show. <br /><br />Dan's availability is extremely limited.
