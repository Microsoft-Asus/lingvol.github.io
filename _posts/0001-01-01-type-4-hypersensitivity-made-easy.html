Type IV hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immunoreaction that is dependent on the presence of a significant number of primed, antigen-specific T cells. This type of reaction is typified by the response to poison ivy, which typically reaches its peak 24 to 48 hours after exposure to antigen. <br /><br />Plant antigens (haptens) react with and modify cellular proteins that are then targeted by the sensitized T cells. Interaction of CD8+ T cells with antigen presented in the context of class I MHC results in the activation of these T cells and induces them to kill target cells displaying these antigens. APCs also display antigen in the context of class II MHC to activate CD4+ T cells to secrete cytokines, including IL-2, which result in the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. The result of these interactions is the amplification of antigen-specific T cells that initiate the hypersensitivity reaction over the course of a few days.
