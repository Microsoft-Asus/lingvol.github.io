What if everybody in the world, all 7.4 billion of us all lived together in the same city? How big or small would this city have to be and how close together or far apart would we all be living from each other? This video explores those concepts and visualizes what a massive global city would look like were it to ever exist in the real world.<br /><br />Huge thanks to Ross Bugden for the excellent music, link below!<br /><br />Ross Bugden Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKGLOK2FqmVgVwYferltKQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKGLOK2FqmVgVwYferltKQ</a><br /><br />Epic and Dramatic Music.
