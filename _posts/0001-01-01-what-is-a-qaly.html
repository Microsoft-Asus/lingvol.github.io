This video is from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/valuing-health">https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/valuing-health</a> ‘Measuring and Valuing Health’ is a free online course by The University of Sheffield available on FutureLearn.com<br /><br />In this video, Katherine demonstrates how to calculate Quality Adjusted Life Years or QALYs; a unit of benefit that can be used to assess the extent of the benefits gained from a variety of healthcare interventions. To calculate QALYs, we multiply the length of life expected to be gained by the new treatment or invention by the quality of life a patient can expect to have. Quality of life is measured on a 0 - 1 scale and this score represents the value of different levels of health.  <br /><br />#FLValuingHealth <br /><br />At FutureLearn, we want to inspire learning for life.
