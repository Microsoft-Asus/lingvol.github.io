Here is a list of common English idioms with meaning and examples included.  Idioms are common in spoken English, and animal idioms are used in many situations (most of them don't include animals) for example, &quot;Hold your horses&quot; means wait or slow down.  If you can think of any more animal idioms then please share below.  I would also like to hear if you have any fun animal phrases in your language. <br />Do let me know if you have any questions about this, and feel free to leave feedback or suggestions for future lessons. <br /><br />üá¨üáß  MY BRITISH ACCENT Course:  www.englishlikeanative.co.uk<br /><br />NOTES available to download from the club member dropbox.<br />üèÜ BECOME A CLUB MEMBER (Join my Skype group, access lesson notes, &amp; access additional lessons): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Hg2Ks00kCekyjZG_LxOmg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Hg2Ks00kCekyjZG_LxOmg/join</a><br /><br />Don't Forget to LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE for a virtual Hi-Five!<br /><br />#Englishlikeanative <br /><br />For those of you who are new to this channel, my name is Anna English.
