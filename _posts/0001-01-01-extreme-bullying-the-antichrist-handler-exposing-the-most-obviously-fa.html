Jeg hater folk som tillegger andre merkelapper ut ifra sin hyklerske religiøse selvrettferdighet «fordi jeg er god må du være ondskapsfull», skjeggete rigide over-religiøse hyklerske antikrist handlers som later som de kunne overlevd uten en å dumpe dritten sin på. Merkelapper fra slike uforanderlige religiøse mørkemenn er katalysatoren som holder mennesket uforent og uopplyst. Krig. Terror. Jeg har ingenting! Jeg har aldri vært noen! Jeg har aldri vært del i en konspirasjon! Og med ingenting mener jeg: Ingenting, ingen venner, familie eller rettigheter. Ei heller har jeg ønsket noe. Jeg er opplyst. Jeg er ikke dømmende, slik som Louis har vært mot sin bestevenn i 9 år. Vi skulle liksom samarbeide og lage TV-show eller redde verden. <br />Hvor er du nå? Likegyldig og apatisk. <br /><br />Alle har vi ansvar ovenfor våre medmennesker. De korsfester både sine synder og sitt ansvar som medmennesker idet de &quot;gir opp livet til Kristus&quot;, og er større syndere enn noen. Dømmende. Ubibelske, hvis noe... Var ikke greia: &quot;Redd prinsessen?&quot; Sånn som Link eller Mario? <br /><br />The voodoo painter and antichrist's Illuminati handler (I never wanted to be an antichrist) tempted me away from the Church into drug abuse and the worst culture on the planet, his cryb was the worst voodoo nest I have seen, even in movies. Then he stabbed his best friend in the back. I took him to Church and Christian arrangements, but he was always too proud. He never went to Church, never preached or even talked about his faith in the drug community and never lived a Christian life. I know him more than anyone. He has been a drug addict all his youth and adult life. He's led countless to perdition. He was the symbol of cultural degeneracy and stoner culture in the city. Now he makes Christian paintings just because he earns money and stats, since he stabbed me in the back. Propagating that &quot;Jesus is Satan and the antichrist&quot;, targeting me for 8 years, years of forgiveness and love on my part. He lied, destroyed, deceived and tempted. And murdered. Before I knew him, I had ambitions, dreams, a Church, a girl, friends, a family and a reputation. He took all that, never cared for me, stabbed me in the back, and is responsible for the current upheavals in the world. I hate the bearded, masculine, rigid, unchanging, hipocritical, proud, unforgiving, accusative religious spirit. Hipocrite!!! Sociopath! Narcissist! Bully! I was the hippie and you were the gangster. Wow so cool. An evil gangster. An over-religious idiot. Yes, I was a really cool, pretty hippie. <br /><br />And I am no-one. Nobody cared about me. I am eternal! Enlightened! No materialism! No rigid religions! No name game! No idols! The guy in question is just the last in a long line of Christian hipocrites pretending they could live without blaming all evil on the antichrist, trying to create him. How very non-Christian.
