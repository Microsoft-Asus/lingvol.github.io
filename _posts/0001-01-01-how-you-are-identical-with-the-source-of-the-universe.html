In this podcast, we will explore the fundamental source of the universe and a lot more. In the three great Eastern traditions of Hinduism, Taoism, and Buddhism the source is described using the terms Brahman, Tao, and Sunyata. Though the philosophical perspective and general worldview may differ among the three traditions, the nondual experience of the source cannot be different and is only perceived as different on a linguistic level due to philosophical differences, something acknowledged by enlightened masters and scholars. We will dissect the similarities and differences of the three traditions and focus on a comprehensive understanding of the ultimate source of all existence.  <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/OneWorldWithin">https://www.youtube.com/OneWorldWithin</a> for new videos every week<br /><br />MY PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/jasongregory">https://patreon.com/jasongregory</a><br /><br />MY BOOKS<br />Emotional Intuition for Peak Performance <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2oZZdFm">https://amzn.to/2oZZdFm</a><br />Effortless Living <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2z0EG3Q">http://amzn.to/2z0EG3Q</a><br />Fasting the Mind <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2zhsAY1">http://amzn.to/2zhsAY1</a><br />Enlightenment Now <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2B2oNuV">http://amzn.to/2B2oNuV</a><br />The Science and Practice of Humility <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2z01WPb">http://amzn.to/2z01WPb</a><br /><br />MY CAMERA GEAR<br />Main Camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DXxuvv">https://amzn.to/2DXxuvv</a><br />Main Lens <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Shk5BF">https://amzn.to/2Shk5BF</a><br />Microphone <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2S6Evgm">https://amzn.to/2S6Evgm</a><br />Tripod <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SdLxA8">https://amzn.to/2SdLxA8</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME<br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jasongregoryauthor/">https://www.instagram.com/jasongregoryauthor/</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JasonGregory33">https://twitter.com/JasonGregory33</a><br />Facebook Personal Page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jason.gregory.oneworldwithin">https://www.facebook.com/jason.gregory.oneworldwithin</a><br />Facebook Like Page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JasonGregoryAuthor/">https://www.facebook.com/JasonGregoryAuthor/</a><br />LinkedIn <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongregoryauthor/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongregoryauthor/</a><br />Amazon Author Page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Gregory/e/B0053O1HKK/">https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Gregory/e/B0053O1HKK/</a><br />Goodreads Author Page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3021190.Jason_Gregory">https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3021190.Jason_Gregory</a><br /><br />MY WEBSITE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jasongregory.org/">https://jasongregory.org/</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: Jason Gregory is an Amazon Associate member.
