At the age of only thirteen, Jacob founded Love for the Elderly, an organization that collects handwritten letters with messages of love and kindness and distributes them to nursing homes across the country.<br /><br /> Inspired by the loss of his grandfather in 2010, Jacob has worked passionately to fight ageism. His efforts have been chronicled in the Huffington Post, Delavida Journal and has earned him 2nd place at Future Problem Solving International.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
