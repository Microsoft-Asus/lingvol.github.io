Simba idolizes his father, King Mufasa, and takes to heart his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the kingdom celebrates the new cub‚Äôs arrival. Scar, Mufasa‚Äôs brother‚Äîand former heir to the throne‚Äîhas plans of his own. The battle for Pride Rock is ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama, ultimately resulting in Simba‚Äôs exile. With help from a curious pair of newfound friends, Simba will have to figure out how to grow up and take back what is rightfully his. The all-star cast includes Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonc√© Knowles-Carter as Nala, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, Seth Rogen as Pumbaa and Billy Eichner as Timon. Utilizing pioneering filmmaking techniques to bring treasured characters to life in a whole new way, Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù roars into theaters on July 19, 2019.<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DisneyTheLionKing">https://www.facebook.com/DisneyTheLionKing</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DisneyLionKing">https://twitter.com/DisneyLionKing</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lionking">https://www.instagram.com/lionking</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://disney.com/lionking">https://disney.com/lionking</a><br /><br />Connect with Disney Music:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/disneymusic">http://instagram.com/disneymusic</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/disneymusic">http://twitter.com/disneymusic</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/disneymusic">http://facebook.com/disneymusic</a><br /><br />#TheLionKing #CanYouFeelTheLoveTonight #DisneyPlus<br /><br />Music video by Beyonc√©, Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen performing Can You Feel the Love Tonight (From &quot;The Lion King&quot;). ¬© 2019 Walt Disney Records<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/0z23r4">http://vevo.ly/0z23r4</a>
