For the third year in a row of Freddy fixing his bowtie, BonBun Films presents the third iteration of his Stay Calm music video. It's currently 5AM in my timezone, but for some of you this video should come out on the right day. I am a lot happier with this video than I am my last remake, and I'd actually consider this my best animation yet.<br /><br />Only took me 2 years to figure out what Craigslist was.<br /><br /><br />Original song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2SEfqgxug4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2SEfqgxug4</a><br /><br />Original video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaicrG6H1zw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaicrG6H1zw</a><br /><br />Griffinilla's channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Griffinilla">https://www.youtube.com/user/Griffinilla</a><br /><br />________________________________________________________<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />There’s a shadow on the wall; stay calm, stay calm<br />There’s a figure in the hall; stay calm, stay calm<br />Keep my wits and stay alive<br />Wish I had a 9 to 5<br />There’s a stranger in us all; stay calm, stay calm<br /><br />Every hair is on it’s end; that’s fine, I’m fine<br />Feeling my adrenaline; that’s fine, I’m fine<br />I can keep away the creeps<br />Safely from my swivel seat<br />Somethings crawling through the vent; that’s fine, ...uh oh<br /><br />There’s a ghost in the machine; stay calm, stay calm<br />They are watching through the screen; stay calm, stay calm<br />They just might drive me crazy. Hit me!<br /><br />Freddy: Hey kids, nice to 'eetcha! Are you ready for some Fazbear pizza?<br />Bonnie: Who’s this, working at the night shift?<br />Foxy: I don’t know, but I don’t think I like him<br />Chica: He’s so cute! I can feel his heart racing!<br />Bonnie: About time we had a brand new plaything<br />Foxy: Another yellow belly balking like a chicken (Chica: Hey!)<br />Freddy: Listen gang, I say that we dig in<br /><br />They are slowly closing in; stay calm, stay calm<br />Find an inner strength within; stay calm, stay calm<br />If I’ve learned one thing it’s that:<br />Don’t respond to craigslist ads<br />I can see their second skin; stay calm...<br /><br />In the end there’s only me; all right, all right<br />Morning sun will set me free; all right, all right<br />I spent Five Nights at Freddy’s. Hit me!<br /><br />Chica: Hey, where did our new friend go?<br />Freddy: Don’t worry, he’ll be back again tomorrow.<br />Bonnie: So, uh, does he not go to the bathroom, or does he just hold it in all night?<br />Foxy: Aye, he pees into a cup.<br />Chica: Ew!<br />Foxy: I’ve seen him do it with me own eye. We were both just staring at eachother. It was extremely awkward.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________
