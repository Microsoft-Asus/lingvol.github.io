* Moroccan-born, Paris-based Hindi Zahra can speak to mountains or whisper in your ear. She can turn rustling plastic bags into Berber beats and Parisian kitchens into soul incubators. Playfully savoring East and West, she writes infectious, unique and ever fresh songs, plays any instrument she can get her hands on, and records her own voice in the middle of the night to capture that perfect spark of intimacy.<br /><br />* All of this is so beautifully captured in this intimate and sublime Unplugged session which can also be found as a wonderful Bonus on her sultry and enthralling Debut album 'Handmade' soon out in the US<br /><br />* Be sure to catch Hindi on her debut album 'Handmade' Tour of North America kicking off Sept 30 in LA at the ooh la L.A! Festival until Oct 19 at Hiro Ballroom at CMJ in NY.<br /><br />* Handmade (na√Øve) including 6 Bonus unplugged session songs out in the US on digital Sept 26 and on CD Oct 11<br /><br /><br /><br />For all things delightfully Hindi Zahra tune in to:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hindi-zahra.com/en/">http://www.hindi-zahra.com/en/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/hindizahra">http://www.facebook.com/hindizahra</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/zahrahindi">http://www.myspace.com/zahrahindi</a>
