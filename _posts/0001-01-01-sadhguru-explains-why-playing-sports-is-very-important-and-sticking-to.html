“The sacredness of a sporting event is that individuals rise beyond their limitations, achieving a state of abandon that is usually known only at the peak of spirituality. Thus, sports have always been a part of Isha, all our programs have an element of play – as to PLAY is to LIVE, and to LIVE is to PLAY.” - Sadhguru<br /><br />Playing Life to the Fullest<br /><br />I want you to see sport not as just a game or one more discipline, but about becoming a sport for life – you are willing to play life to the fullest. The game is not just badminton, table tennis or volleyball. Living in this world is a game. Whatever we do is a certain kind of game. Education also is a certain kind of game. How good or bad you are is not the issue. It is the intensity of involvement. If you are fully involved, you will see it is enriching.<br /><br />The simplest things become great because someone threw themselves into it absolutely. It does not matter what one may choose, if you put everything you have into whatever you are doing, it is great. What is the big deal in hitting or kicking a ball? But the entire world sits up and watches when someone does it – not because of the ball or the goal – simply because someone is throwing himself into it like his life depends on it. It does not matter how good or bad you are at it, you cannot ever play a game halfheartedly. You know you can do education halfheartedly! But you cannot play a game halfheartedly.<br /><br />Donate to Sadhguru's projects: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en">https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling">https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling</a><br /><br />Relax and Enjoy Isha Rejuvenation Retreats:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ishafoundation.org/Inner-Transformation/isha-rejuvenation.isa">https://www.ishafoundation.org/Inner-Transformation/isha-rejuvenation.isa</a><br /><br />Official Sadhguru Website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.isha.sadhguru.org">http://www.isha.sadhguru.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.innerengineering.com/">https://www.innerengineering.com/</a><br /><br />Like my page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Ready4Adventure-318317888580691/">https://www.facebook.com/Ready4Adventure-318317888580691/</a><br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br /><br />* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
