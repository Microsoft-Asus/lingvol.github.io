I can only make it halfway up. Any good suggestions for me?&quot;<br /><br />Sit up mistake #1: pulling on your neck<br />Typically the sit up can be bad for your spine when you pull on your neck to initiate the sit up, rather than contracting your abs to pull your ribs towards your pelvis.<br /><br />Sit up mistake #2: incorrect pelvis position<br />The sit up can also be bad for your lower back depending on the positioning of your pelvis during the beginning and end of the range of motion.<br /><br />One of the key coaching cues with the sit up is to start and finish the sit up with your pelvis maintaining a posterior tilt.<br /><br />This means your lower back should be flat against the floor, during the beginning position of the sit up.<br /><br />You should not have an arch or room to slide your hand between the floor and your lower back. This can cause back pain.<br /><br />Sit up mistake #3: relaxing your abs between reps<br />It’s important to fully lengthen and shorten your abs during the sit up, without allowing them to relax.<br /><br />As you lower your upper torso back towards the floor, you’re lengthening the abs, but once you feel the contraction is gone, you’ve gone too far.<br /><br />This typically happens when you lay your head back on the ground in between reps.<br /><br />Also, if you’re coming up too high, to the point where you no longer feel a contraction in your abs, stop and lower back down until you feel the contraction again.<br /><br />Think about bringing your ribs towards your pelvis and staying in the range of motion where your stomach and abs are always contracted.<br /><br />Sit up mistake #4: not contracting or breathing properly<br />Remember, to sculpt your abs, think about the quality of the contraction.<br /><br />This is much more important than how many reps you can do, or how fast you can do them.<br /><br />During the contraction, think about tightening and pulling your lower abs inward as you exhale.<br /><br />It’s not an exhale where you loosen your abs and push them out. This can give you the bloated abs look.<br /><br />Keep your lower abs contracted and pulled in, as if you were pulling your belly button towards your back.<br /><br />Think about sucking in your obliques towards your midline, as you exhale.<br /><br />This will help you pull in and contract your abs at the same time.<br /><br />This is one of the best training tips to create a slimmer waist.<br /><br />2 beginner tips on how to do sit ups correctly for beginners<br /><br />#1. Anchor your feet so they are flat on the floor<br />There are many items you can use anchor your feet flat to the floor, including a:<br />- Pair of dumbbells<br />- Couch<br />- Partner<br /><br />By anchoring your feet flat to the floor, it can help provide leverage to raise your upper body all the way to the top of the sit up.<br /><br />Just remember to keep your pelvis in the posterior tilt position, by not lowering and resting your head back to the floor.<br /><br />#2. Use your arms to create a little momentum<br />Although it’s important that the contraction in the abs is primary cause of the sit up, you can use your arms to create a little momentum.<br /><br />You can do this by extending your arms forward as your sit up or simply bring your elbows in front of your body, rather than flared out to the sides.<br /><br />WANT MORE DAILY TIPS ON HOW TO LIVE LEAN?:<br />✔ INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/bradgouthro">http://www.instagram.com/bradgouthro</a><br />✔ INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/JessicaGouthroFitness">http://www.instagram.com/JessicaGouthroFitness</a><br />✔ INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/LiveLeanTV">http://www.instagram.com/LiveLeanTV</a><br />✔ SNAPCHAT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.snapchat.com/add/bradgouthro">http://www.snapchat.com/add/bradgouthro</a> <br />✔ SNAPCHAT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.snapchat.com/add/SnapyJessy">http://www.snapchat.com/add/SnapyJessy</a><br />✔ FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/LiveLeanTV">http://www.facebook.com/LiveLeanTV</a><br />✔ TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/bradgouthro">http://www.twitter.com/bradgouthro</a><br />✔ TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/JessiFit">http://www.twitter.com/JessiFit</a><br />✔ TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/LiveLeanTV">http://www.twitter.com/LiveLeanTV</a><br /><br />Welcome to Live Lean TV.
