I had been married for 10 years with no kids (her decision). 3 years ago she cheated on me. 3 months after dday she decided that I was too important for het to let me go and ended her affair and we rebuilt our marriage. <br /><br />I have just discovered a new affair I have been battling with her every since. She doesn't wants the affair to end. Her excuse is that she is this way she feels she is wired different and that I should accept her. <br /><br />That she is free that I must appreciate and alwsys enjoy when she wants to be with me. But that she can be free to go see her lover. I am trying to understand her. so I started to learn about non monogamy. I may be a fool but I want to save my marriage. I talked to her about an open marriage but she went nuts. Yelling to me that I only want to cheat on her with her consent. So she didn't accept. <br /><br />There are multiple aspects to this story. First she always said she hated cheaters that having more than one love was not normal that she was 100 % percent to monogamy. Due to my parents marriage falling apart for an affair on my teenage years I decided I wanted to stay with the woman I choose forever. So I was completely into this marriage. Her affair is with a married man with children. His wife found about the affair too and he kicked her out of his house so he can be free to have his affair. <br /><br />My wife doesn't wants to end the relationship with me rather she just wants me to let her be.{% endraw %}
