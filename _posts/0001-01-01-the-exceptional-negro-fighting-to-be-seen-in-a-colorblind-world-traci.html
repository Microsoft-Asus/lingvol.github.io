America works overtime to create a colorblind society, but does this colorblindness perpetuate, rather than resolve, racism? Despite a growing racial divide, attorney, activist and author Traci Ellis says the time is now to have the courageous conversation about the damage done in the name of colorblindness. Traci Oâ€™Neal Ellis is a Chicago-area based attorney, HR professional, frequent speaker on race, law, and politics, and radically inclusive leadership and she is a fierce advocate for social justice.<br /><br />She earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Florida A &amp; M University and a Juris Doctor degree at The Ohio State University.<br /><br />In addition to her professional pursuits, Traci is also very active in her community. She was an elected official, serving seven years as a member of a large, urban school district before resigning in April, 2018 to pursue her activism on a broader and deeper scale. She is also on the board of directors of a local hospital.<br /><br />Traci was named the 2012 YWCA Leader Award winner of the Beatrice Dorsey Award for Business and Professions, as well as the 2018 City of Elgin, IL Human Relations Commission Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Humanitarian Award winner.<br /><br />Traci is also the author of The Exceptional Negro: Racism, White Privilege and the Lie of Respectability Politics. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
