What are gray sheet stocks? What do these mean?” <br /><br />Well, waaaay back in the day when stocks were traded on paper, the color corresponded to the quality of the stock. Pink stocks are very low-funded, risky stocks.<br /><br />To get involved with penny stocks, you need to know the basics … the vocabulary … the terminology … recognition of the different strategies and patterns.<br /><br />Acknowledge that preparation is key. It’s not about finding that one hot stock — it’s about studying the past and being prepared! <br /><br />Sometimes the best-performing stocks have the worst financials. What makes them successful? Their potential! <br /><br />If these ‘sketchy,’ poorly financed stocks get backed by big companies like Apple, the stock can double or triple in a few minutes and hours, or even over days or weeks.<br /><br />This is what you need to prepare for. You can use your knowledge to take advantage of these plays. Buy the stock with limits and hold it until you can (hopefully) profit — because other people are trying to buy in. <br /><br />Bottom line: Learn the process and prepare for this. Recognize that these trades take more time to execute and prepare accordingly. Consider execution time and trading with limits. <br />Focus on your education and preparation. One trade won’t make you rich, but poorly executed and planned trades can make you poor. <br /><br />Learn how to navigate and profit off these risky stocks now.  <br /><br />Do you trade pink sheet stocks? What’s your strategy?
