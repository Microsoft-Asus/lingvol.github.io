Drowned World/Substitute For Love<br />Madonna<br />Ray Of Light [1998]<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I traded fame for love<br />Without a second thought<br />It all became a silly a game<br />Some things cannot be bought<br /><br />I got exactly what I asked for<br />Wanted it so badly<br />Running, rushing back for more<br />I suffered fools so gladly<br /><br />And now I find<br />I've changed my mind<br /><br />The face of you<br />My substitute for love<br />My substitute for love<br />Should I wait for you<br />My substitute for love<br />My substitute for love<br /><br />I traveled round the world<br />Looking for a home<br />I found myself in crowded rooms<br />Feeling so alone<br /><br />I had so many lovers<br />Who settled for the thrill<br />Of basking in my spotlight<br />I never felt so happy<br /><br />The face of you<br />My substitute for love<br />My substitute for love<br />Should I wait for you<br />My substitute for love<br />My substitute for love<br /><br />Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm<br />Famous faces, far off places<br />Trinkets I can buy<br />No handsome stranger, heady danger<br />Drug that I can try<br />No ferris wheel, no heart to steal<br />No laughter in the dark<br />No one-night stand, no far-off land<br />No fire that I can spark<br />Mmmmm, mmmmm<br /><br />The face of you<br />My substitute for love<br />My substitute for love<br />Should I wait for you<br />My substitute for love<br />My substitute for love<br /><br />Now I find I've changed my mind<br />This is my religion
