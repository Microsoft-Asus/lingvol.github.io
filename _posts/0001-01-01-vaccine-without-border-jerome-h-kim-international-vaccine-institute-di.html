* Vaccine Without Border│Jerome H. Kim(International Vaccine Institute, Director General): The world is desperately waiting for an effective vaccine for coronavirus because the pandemic is hitting the world so hard. However, the vaccine requires international cooperation from many perspectives: first of all, vaccines need concerted R&amp;D beyond country borders. Also, the vaccine should be supplied to not one country only but the whole world. In a short, vaccines must be without border. They are necessities in COVID-19 era. Top global experts on vaccines will gather to give their insights on vaccines without border. They are Jerome Kim, Director General of the International Vaccine Institute; Seth Berkley, CEO of GAVI; and Xiang-Jin Meng; professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. #Vaccine, #IVI, #JeromeKim
