In this program, Les Brown provides a foundational key that can propel you to your next higher level. There are times in life when it seems hard to actually affirm that you can make it; and that you can actually overcome that particular obstacle and attain that new height. You can’t always say I know I can and keep integrity with yourself and your true feelings. What you can use as a benchmark and a place to always fall back to is “It’s Possible!<br /><br />Shared for historical purposes.
