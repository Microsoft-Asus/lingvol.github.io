Shake and strain over fresh ice in a double rocks glass. Garnish with orange slice and cherry.<br /><br />Whiskey sour is a cocktail that does not have the greatest reputation. I think the reason for that is that sour makes people think of sour mix, which is this disgusting, processed fake ingredient. But you really shouldn't be afraid, because sour is actually just a style of cocktail. Back in the 19th century a sour just meant a drink that had a spirit, citrus and some sugar or simple syrup. That's really all a whiskey sour is, it's whiskey, lemon juice and simple syrup.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this drink is it's a great way to still have whiskey, if you really like whiskey in hot weather in the summer, because it's a really refreshing drink. So we're going to start with our spirit. Two ounces of rye whiskey, you can also use bourbon. I just love rye whiskey, let's face it. But this is also a drink that bourbon works great in too.<br /><br />Now we'll do equal parts sugar and citrus. Three-quarters of an ounce of simple syrup. Again that's just one part sugar to one part water dissolved together. Three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, very important. You know that's the step that people decided they didn't want to do, and so instead they created sour mix, which then made people hate the whiskey sour. So this is the most important ingredient in your whiskey sour. <br /><br />Now I'm going to do something else that's a very classic touch to the whiskey sour. It might scare you a little bit, but just bear with me. I'm going to add a little bit of egg white. There's alcohol in there, so whatever fears you have of raw eggs, whatever could maybe be in there, the alcohol is going to kill, so don't worry about that. What it's going to do is not really add so much in the way of taste, but it's going to add a really nice frothy texture that's going to be great. <br /><br />So we're going to do the egg whites, so just separate the egg white. Here you go. Toss the rest. As always it is very handy to have a trash can nearby to make your life easier. Whenever there's a raw egg in the drink, we're going to do something called a dry shake, which means to shake it without ice first to emulsify the egg. Then we'll shake it again with ice to chill it. <br /><br />Just a few shakes to do that. You can see it's nice and frothy. Now we'll add our ice. Whiskey sour is a drink that you can serve on the rocks or up. I like it on the rocks, especially if you have those really nice ice cube trays that make the big 1 x 1 cubes, which I happen to have on hand. You'll see the results in a minute. <br /><br />Just so you can see, that ice cube is perfectly square. That means it won't melt as fast in the drink. There are only four ice cubes in there, so it won't water down your drink too fast. Okay, and now it's time to shake for real. Oh yeah, check this out. See how frothy that is? It gives it a really nice, silky texture. That's all from the egg white and again, it's not really going to add anything in the way of flavor. <br /><br />We're going to garnish the whiskey sour with an orange and cherry flag. it will really liven things up. See we have a toothpick, you kind of spear it like that and then grab your cherries. One right on top and then sort of get in there, so the top is poking out. And there you have it, so no need to be afraid anymore. That is how you make a classic whiskey sour.{% endraw %}
