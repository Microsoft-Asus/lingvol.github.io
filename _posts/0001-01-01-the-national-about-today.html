Lyrics:<br />Today you were far away<br />and I didn't ask you why<br />What could I say<br />I was far away<br />You just walked away<br />and I just watched you<br />What could I say<br /> <br />How close am I to losing you<br /> <br />Tonight you just close your eyes<br />and I just watch you<br />slip away<br /> <br />How close am I to losing you<br /> <br />Hey, are you awake<br />Yeah I'm right here<br />Well can I ask you about today<br /> <br />How close am I to losing you<br />How close am I to losing <br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.americanmary.com/">http://www.americanmary.com/</a>
