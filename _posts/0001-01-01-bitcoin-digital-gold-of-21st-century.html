Is Bitcoin Really Digital Gold?<br /><br />Bitcoin (BTC) has extended its eye-popping rally. It passed the US$18,000 level in the last week and is getting closer to its record high of almost US $20,000 set in December 2017. Faced with unprecedented monetary expansion and lower interest rates, some investors have sought Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. Bitcoin shares some characteristics of gold such as scarcity, fungibility, and durability. Additionally, it is easily divisible, recognizable, portable and transferable, which possesses a superior composition of 'good money' qualities made for a digital global economy.<br /><br />On the other hand, some people are highly doubtful about Bitcoin's prospects and treat it as a 'speculative bubble' and is unlikely to become a real currency. Another big flaw with Bitcoin is its volatility. It falls into the high-risk asset category with double-digit variation per day being common. <br /><br />In this webinar, Avaneesh Acquilla, CIO at Arrano Capital, Michael Wong, Co-founder &amp; Managing Partner at MaiCapital and Vivek Mohindra, Co-founder &amp; Responsible Officer at Kristal.AI, discussed the evolution of Bitcoin and explored the drivers of demand and supply of Bitcoin.
