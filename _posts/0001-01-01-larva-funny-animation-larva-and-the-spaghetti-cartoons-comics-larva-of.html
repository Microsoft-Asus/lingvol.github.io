Yellow is always abused by Red, but that never endangers their friendship. Although usually he obeys Red, he loses his mind in front of food.<br />❤️ Red ❤️<br />Red is a mostly hot-tempered and greedy red colored larva. His specialty is shouting and kicking like Bruce Lee. He is always showing off and abusing Yellow, but he often ends up hurting himself instead.<br />💜 Violet 💜<br />Violet is an oversized ghost slug. He is sometimes shown with his lower half buried in the ground. When he is threatened, he exposes his whole body and roars.<br />🚪 Brown 🚪<br />Brown is a cloying dung beetle that gathers poop. To him, poop is either his food or his treasure. He hates it when other insects touch his prized poop. He has a long strand of hair on his right cheek.<br />⚫️ Black ⚫️<br />Black is a horned atlas beetle that has great strength and is usually punching a cocoon (which he uses as punching bag). He's aggressive and will beat up whoever he thinks is messing with him. In &quot;Hello, Black&quot; he turns out to be a slug wearing beetle armor.<br />🌈  Rainbow 🌈<br />Rainbow is a snail with a red and green shell. When in his shell, he's slow in his action, but under that he has a muscular human-like body and can function like humans do.<br />💟 Pink 💟<br />Pink is a pink larva with two antennae. She is the only recurring female character. She loves Yellow but Red loves her. She hides a great strength behind her cute, beautiful face.<br /><br />#larva #larvacartoon #larvatuba
