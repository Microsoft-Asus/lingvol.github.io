As Director of the Benaroya Institute at Virginia Mason and the Immune Tolerance Network, Immunologist and Biomedical Researcher Gerald Nepom, MD, PhD, has dedicated himself to understanding the moment when the body turns against itself, causing diseases such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and how by decoding our genes we can better relate to our immune system.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
