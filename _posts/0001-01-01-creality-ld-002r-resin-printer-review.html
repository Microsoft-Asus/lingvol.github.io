Yet another budget resin printer, this time from an established manufacturer. In this video, I print a range of models with the Creality LD-002R. This was a pre-production model and based off the comments in the LD-002R Facebook group, some of the issues that annoyed me in this review have been fixed already.<br /><br />I didn't have a failed print while testing this unit, and the results are quite good. This seems to be on par with most of the other printers in this price range. Please inspect my results closely as well as those from other reviews and make a decision from there.<br /><br />This printer provided free of charge by Creality for the purposes of making this review. All opinions expressed are my own.<br /><br />Purchase the LD-002R: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/ld-002r-lcd-resin-3d-printer?sca_ref=16987.xbmLCEL46n">https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/ld-002r-lcd-resin-3d-printer?sca_ref=16987.xbmLCEL46n</a><br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Rh7LDw">https://amzn.to/2Rh7LDw</a><br />Banggood: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.banggood.com/custlink/DD3DAQAUEh">https://www.banggood.com/custlink/DD3DAQAUEh</a><br />LD-002R Facebook group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/544206109517472/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/544206109517472/</a><br /><br />Models in this video:<br />Darth Vader bust: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-darth-vader-anakin-skywalker-from-star-wars-107592">https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-darth-vader-anakin-skywalker-from-star-wars-107592</a><br />Vampire Hunter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-103837">https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-103837</a><br />Vampire Count: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-103838">https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-103838</a><br />Stormtrooper ring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1184287">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1184287</a><br />Lion ring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1124255">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1124255</a><br />Open source hardware ring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:358031">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:358031</a><br />Dragon chess rook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-104929">https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-104929</a><br />Bjorn Steeleblodd 28mm mini: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3472638/">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3472638/</a><br />Lattice cube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1856832">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1856832</a><br />Twin castle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3940232">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3940232</a><br />Eiffel tower: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22051">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22051</a><br /><br />Buy quality and affordable filament from X3D.
