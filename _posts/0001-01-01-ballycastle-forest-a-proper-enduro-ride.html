Not for the faint hearted these trails the fitter the better as iv found out quite technical in parts steep in parts and flat in parts so proper enduro riders trails. I wasnt feeling the best as you will prob hear me complain lol but still had a great day this was filmed weeks ago and iv just got round to putting it up so hopefully if you go up thing might be a bit drier in places!thanks for watching pls leave you comments i will answer them and hit the like or dislike which ever you feel but tell us why so we can keep moving forward thanks.
