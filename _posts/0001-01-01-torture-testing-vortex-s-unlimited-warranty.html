{% raw %}Most of us have heard about Vortex's &quot;unlimited&quot; warranty.  Everyone knows a guy who heard of someone who found a burned-out Vortex scope in the forest and sent it in just to see if Vortex would send them a new one.  But does Vortex really honor that warranty?<br /><br />In this video, we set out to torture test a set of Vortex Crossfire binoculars for two reasons.  First, to see just how well they hold up to abuse.  But second, to see just how far we can go and still get Vortex to honor their warranty.  Frankly, in this case they shouldn't but let's just see.<br /><br />Note: we would never take advantage of a company like this.  So if Vortex does honor their warranty, we commit to purchasing enough products from them (that we otherwise wouldn't) to more than make up for the cost of these binoculars.  No one should ever abuse a company's generous warranty.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Do not attempt any stunts seen on this channel.  Actors are trained firearms professionals.
