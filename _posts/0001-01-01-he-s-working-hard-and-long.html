Kitty gets trapped! How'd it happen? We go to our last Occupational therapy appointment. We listen to all the F-35 jet planes in the sky and we know that Hadar is working hard! We see an old hotel with lots of poopy visitors who are so rude! You can also see bomb shelters on the side of the building. We visit a different grocery store to find different Israeli foods. There's really no selection here. You get hard white cheese or soft white cheese. Our grocery stores here are the size of a Dollar Tree. We sing together while I feed Abigail. The baby starts to sing a bit, too. I take Rafael to gymnastics. For someone who &quot;never goes out,&quot; I surely am tired of going out! <br />YESTERDAY'S VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7dRIFp2jcCQ">https://youtu.be/7dRIFp2jcCQ</a><br />Life in Israel!

Hadar met Andrea in real life, in Israel. We were married in 2010 in America. Andrea moved to Israel in July of that same year and has been there ever since. We miscarried a baby at 4 months gestation, shortly after we were married. Rafael was born November 2012. Baby Abigail was born July 2016. Both were born in Israel. We film our life every day to show Andrea's family members back in FL. Andrea also has an adult son, named Zebulin who lives and works in America. Hadar is a soldier in the Air Force in Israel. <br /><br />We are a fun loving and happy family. We are not fake family vloggers. You will never see us being fake. Views are not as important to us as our integrity. Many of our family and real life friends watch our videos. You can be assured that what you are seeing is 100% truth and reality. You will not only see the best of us, but the worst of us as well. We all have a story to tell and it's not always pretty. For us, it will always be realistic. I do not make videos just for you. These are my family's memories. There would be no point in making videos if it weren't the truth. We are transparent and honest with everything. Please remember, when leaving a comment, that we are not characters on a tv show. We are real people.<br /><br />About our baby boy: Rafael was diagnosed with OCD and High Functioning Autism, also known as Aspergers syndrome. We have a few videos of Rafael so you can understand his diagnosis better:<br /><br />DAY IN THE LIFE of a 3 Year Old with High Functioning Autism (Aspergers Syndrome): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-Oyj89ynMNA">https://youtu.be/-Oyj89ynMNA</a><br /><br />OCD in a 3 Year Old: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GPcIrNnsruc">https://youtu.be/GPcIrNnsruc</a><br /><br />I do vlog him having meltdowns, dealing with ocd, and his occupational therapy sessions. Soon, he will go to speech therapy as well. Autism and OCD should not be taboo to talk about. Every parent dealing with autism has to deal with these issues. I want you to know you are not alone. I want my videos to help people who have not dealt with autism. I hope to make it normal to them and they stop judging parents who are literally doing the best they can for their kids.<br /><br />PLEASE SUBSCRIBE!<br />NEW VIDEOS EVERY SINGLE DAY!<br /><br />LEAVE US A COMMENT TO LET US KNOW YOU WERE HERE!
