This is what 24 hours of sunlight at the North, and South pole, looks like from 22,000 miles in space. Each sequence of photos is 11 time lapsed days in duration. Each time lapsed day completes in 14 seconds. These time lapses show that the sun does shine on BOTH of the poles 24 hours per day, in June for the North Pole, and December for the South Pole. The latter cannot happen on a flat earth since flat <br />earth doesn't believe in the South Pole.<br /><br />The images were shot by the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite in June  2016, and December 2015. The Himawari takes a photo of the earth every 10 minutes, 144 photos per day, each photo is 11,000 x 11,000. The images are then compressed enough to be able to make MP4 time lapses and file sizes reasonable.
