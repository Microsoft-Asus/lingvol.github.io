Climate Change in the Caribbean - A simple Intro to climate Change and how it relates to life in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Donald Trump and his climate skeptic supporters should take a look at this video, maybe they could learn a thing or two. Cuz here in the Caribbean the effects are being felt and we are getting the message loud and clear. So in this video I give a quick explanation of what climate change is and what it means for us and our water resources issues here in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Barbados! More than just breathtaking landscapes and luxurious resorts. It's a vibrant place where our unique culture comes out in everything that we do.<br /><br />Special credit goes out to USAID, The Barbados Drainage Division and The Centre For Resource Management And Environmental Studies.
