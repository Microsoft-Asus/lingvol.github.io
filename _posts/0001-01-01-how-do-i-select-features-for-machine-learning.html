Selecting the &quot;best&quot; features for your Machine Learning model will result in a better performing, easier to understand, and faster running model. But how do you know which features to select?<br /><br />In this video, I'll discuss 7 feature selection tactics used by the pros that you can apply to your own model. At the end, I'll give you my top 3 tips for effective feature selection.<br /><br />WANT TO JOIN MY NEXT WEBCAST?
