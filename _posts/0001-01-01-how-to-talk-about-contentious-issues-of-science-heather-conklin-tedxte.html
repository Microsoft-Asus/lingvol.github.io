Climate change. Masks during COVID. Vaccines. How do we talk about issues of science with people who don't share our views? Social scientist and science communicator, Heather Conklin, explores how an unlikely hero can help us think critically and reduce polarization on contentious issues of science. She calls this hero The Skeptic: a person who finds room for doubt, yet continues to search for answers, so that we can embrace the space in the middle. In her work as a social scientist, science communicator, and social entrepreneur, Heather Conklin explores the intersection of science, politics, and society to build a more informed and engaged world. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
