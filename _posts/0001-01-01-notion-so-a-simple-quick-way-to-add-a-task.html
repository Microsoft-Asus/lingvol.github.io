Notion.so is a blank slate with many features and possibilities. I think it is helpful to see what others are doing, and how others are using and shaping their Notion space. This is my first contribution towards that conversation. I have not done any kind of screencast before, so hopefully, my presentation will not impede too much, and will improve over time!<br /><br />Try Notion here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.notion.so/?r=64d535550dd34077bd2d3d2cce32a44f">https://www.notion.so/?r=64d535550dd34077bd2d3d2cce32a44f</a>
