Samuel Johnson, the Dancing Master and Jester of Gawsworth Hall is buried in Maggoty Wood and I frequently walk past his grave, when I go walking there with my dog. I rather fancy this tune might match his interesting occupation.<br />Notation google shortened link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/X5Px2D">https://goo.gl/X5Px2D</a>
