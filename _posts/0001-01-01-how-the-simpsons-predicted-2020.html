The Simpsons predicted the future before, but now they got all of 2020 right!<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />Remember when The Simpsons used to just be a fun animated show that parodied pop culture and not a clairvoyant show where they eerily predicted the future? As you probably know- The Simpsons have made what feels like hundreds of correct predictions about the future- including the building of The Shard in London, the Higgs Boson equation and even the Cats movie bombing at the Box Office. These predictions are scarily accurate and make us ponder if the writers are more than everyday coffee stained humans, or they are somehow mystics who can accurately predict the future. Further evidence of this is some of the crazy calls they have made about 2020. If Professor Umbridge was a year- 2020 would be it. We have had a wild ride in 2020, with us mere mortals completely unable to predict some of the events that have occurred- but the writers at The Simpsons somehow did...<br /><br />In this video we will take a look at some of the most relevant predictions and jokes they have made that we have experienced this year. From global pandemics, to giant flying insects to viral sensations, we will take a look at some of the worst predictions The Simpsons made for us. Dâ€™oh!<br /><br />What was your scariest prediction? What Simpsons prediction do you not want to come true?
