There’s a new type of breakup maneuver that I’ve coined as the ‘Grand Gesture Goodbye.’ Your partner pulls out all the stops to validate their affection, incredible vacation, passionate weekend, or an amazing dinner. You’re blissfully elated and certain of their love. Then, you’re dumped without warning. The grand gesture goodbye was just an elaborate way to alleviate their guilt.<br /><br />Personal Coaching: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.susanwinter.net/consultation/">http://www.susanwinter.net/consultation/</a><br />Or, call me on Magnifi: (on demand) by-the-minute coaching<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://provider.magnifi.io/Susan">https://provider.magnifi.io/Susan</a><br /><br />* Beware of scammers on this site and as well as other YouTube providers.
