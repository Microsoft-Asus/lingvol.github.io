There ap­peared in Lon­don a man who styled him­self the mes­si­ah, and for ma­ny weeks a large crowd was at­tract­ed to him. One night, how­ev­er, as he was talk­ing in one of the open squares in the city, a small band of the Sal­va­tion Ar­my passed along, sing­ing,<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;I shall know Him, I shall know Him,<br /><br />By the print of the nails in His hand.&quot;<br /><br />The great throng joined in the cho­rus. Fin­al­ly some­one point­ed at the self-styled Christ and said, &quot;Look at his hands and see if the print of the nails is there.&quot; They did as di­rect­ed, but no print ap­peared, and they at once left off fol­low­ing him.
