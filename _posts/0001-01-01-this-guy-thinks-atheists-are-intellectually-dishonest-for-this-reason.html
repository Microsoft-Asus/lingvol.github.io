Today, Graham Jeacocke is going to try and convince us that Atheists are intellectually dishonest. Honestly, it's just a bunch of incoherent rambling about how the Romans didn't value life, which isn't true, and how Christianity was put on trial to defend that it was good for humanity. He then claims that we need to defend ourselves in the court of public opinion and declare what atheism really is. Apparently, that will be the ultimate test of Atheism yet he claims that could never happen because we can't defend our rights in court. <br /><br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8JuDYsEIpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8JuDYsEIpU</a><br /><br />Get 25% Off Ekster Wallets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GEWalletDeal">https://bit.ly/GEWalletDeal</a><br /><br />Subscribe to this channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://SubToGE.com">http://SubToGE.com</a><br />Join the Skeptic Mafia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://JoinSkepticMafia.com">http://JoinSkepticMafia.com</a><br />Download CHRESTUS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chrest.us">https://chrest.us</a><br /><br />Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JoinGodlessDiscord">http://bit.ly/JoinGodlessDiscord</a><br /><br />Intro by &quot;Gonna Go For it&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/1Ay1Q3">https://goo.gl/1Ay1Q3</a>
