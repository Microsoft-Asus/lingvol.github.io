The COVID19 pandemic has required mental health practitioners to shift from providing largely in-person therapeutic intervention, to operating a complete Telemental Health psychotherapy practice.  This change not only requires knowledge of ethical and legal requirements (i.e. informed consent, emergency back-up plans) but also the application of clinical strategies face-to-face over the internet. This brief training will focus on strategies for clinicians to engage children and teens in individual and group psychotherapy, during (and after) this unprecedented time of physical distancing.
