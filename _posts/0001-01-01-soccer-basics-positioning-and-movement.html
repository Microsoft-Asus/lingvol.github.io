I never thought it would reach a million views!<br />*********************<br />This is a basic lesson on where and how to move around on the soccer field.  This is NOT about how to play a specific position because there are plenty of videos that teach that sort of thing.  This video focuses on fundamental concepts that every player should know, but it does focus more on offense.
