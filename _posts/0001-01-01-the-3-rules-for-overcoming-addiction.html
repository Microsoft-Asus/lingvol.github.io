So today I want to go over 3 rules that you have to stick to if you want to overcome your addictions and start seeing progress in life. Overcoming addiction isn't about pure willpower, it's about having the right strategies and knowing what to focus on to solve the root of the problem. <br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm not a licensed medical professional of any kind. I'm just some guy on the internet telling you about some observations, I've made in my own life. If you have a SERIOUS addiction (one that's putting your life in danger) then you should seek out the help of a medical professional.<br /> <br />Tamed Course (FREE Habit Building Course): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/m8JjuyRIxOg">https://youtu.be/m8JjuyRIxOg</a> <br /><br />BeeFriend Course (FREE Social Skills Course): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfGgOfmbx4&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiHbUFDuNnqxfui3lrE2jjwO&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfGgOfmbx4&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiHbUFDuNnqxfui3lrE2jjwO&amp;index=1</a> <br /><br />Otter Half Course (FREE Dating Advice For Men/Women Course): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X192TfMLIHU&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiFgkO0OkThMgAEUChL_NQ8y&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X192TfMLIHU&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiFgkO0OkThMgAEUChL_NQ8y&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s</a> <br /><br />The Online Business Playlist (will be gradually adding to this over time): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e7ONbUG58o&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiGds5wLnOr2Db3Oncmt6F5U&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e7ONbUG58o&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiGds5wLnOr2Db3Oncmt6F5U&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s</a><br /><br />For Business/Animation Job Inquiries: Email Me At ImprovementPill@Gmail.com<br /><br />Intro: (00:00)<br />Rule #1: (00:28)<br />My Obsession This Year: (00:58)<br />Rule #2: (01:48)<br />Sponsor: (02:24)<br />Rule #3: (03:21)<br />Why AA Is So Effective: (03:55)<br />How To Socialize More: (04:25)<br />Improvement Pill Discord Server: (04:54)<br />A Quick Recap + Easter Egg: (05:34)
