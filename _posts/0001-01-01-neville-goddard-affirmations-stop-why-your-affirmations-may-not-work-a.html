{% raw %}Neville Goddard affirmations: STOP! Why your affirmations may not work and what to do instead (2021)<br /><br />Positive affirmations can be useless or even dangerous. Stop forcing yourself to repeat them over and over again like a crazy parrot, trying to convince yourself of something that you actually already are...<br /><br />&quot;You are already that which you want to be, and your refusal to believe it is the only reason you do not see it.&quot; (Neville Goddard)<br /><br />You've probably heard of affirmations before, right? In short, affirmations are positively worded sentences that you say, think or write down over and over again.<br /><br />Typically these are sentences that describe how you would like to be or how you would like to view yourself.<br /><br />I am rich.<br />I am loved.<br />I am healthy.<br />I am beautiful.<br />I am happy.<br />I am in a relationship (with ...)<br /><br />Affirmations are very often recommended to reprogram our subconscious and thereby overwrite negative beliefs. They should help to get rid of negative emotions, build self-confidence and generally increase our mood.<br /><br />The problem with affirmations is that a lot of people don't believe them and they are more likely to provoke resistance than create positive emotions. Our brain responds to a positive affirmation with ‚ÄúOh, what nonsense! Don't lie to me! I don't see any prove of that! &quot;<br /><br />You don't need to use affirmations if it doesn't feel good. If affirmations make you feel negative, don't use them. Just because affirmations work for many people, and many people swear by them, doesn't mean they are useful for everyone.<br /><br />Learn in this video what you should use instead of affirmations.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Your subconscious impressions determine the conditions of your world. The subconscious is not selective; it is impersonal and no respecter of persons. The subconscious is not concerned with the truth or falsity of your feeling. It always accepts as true that which you feel to be true. Feeling is the assent of the subconscious to the truth of that which is declared to be true. Because of this quality of the subconscious there is nothing impossible to man. Whatever the mind of man can conceive and feel as true, the subconscious can and must objectify.&quot; (Neville Goddard)<br /><br /><br />üìå In this video you are going to learn:<br />- Why your affirmations most probably won't work<br />- The process to make them actually work for you<br />- The best alternative for using affirmations<br /><br /><br />üéÅ Watch my free masterclass:<br />- The reason why your self-concept determines everything in your life<br />- The main difference between Law of Attraction &amp; Law of Assumption<br />- The only method you need to manifest your desires (Specific person &amp; money)<br />- 6 shifts to become a manifestation machine &amp; master your life<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://upgradetolife.com/masterclass">https://upgradetolife.com/masterclass</a><br /><br />üëÅ Join the UPGRADE TO LIFE EXPERIENCE program:<br />We're open for enrollment!
