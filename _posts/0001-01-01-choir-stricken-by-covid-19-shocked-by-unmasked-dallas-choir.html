{% raw %}A 100-person choir in Dallas is facing backlash for performing without masks last weekend at a megachurch attended by Vice President Mike Pence. Some of their critics are members of another choir in Washington State who survived one of the first known &quot;super-spreading&quot; instances of COVID-19 in the country. Inside Edition spoke with some of the 53 members of the Skagit Valley Chorale who contracted COVID-19 in March. Some of them say they are still experiencing symptoms.{% endraw %}
