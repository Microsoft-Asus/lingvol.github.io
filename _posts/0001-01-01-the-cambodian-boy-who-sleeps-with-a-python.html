Snake Boy (2008):  In Cambodia, a real-life Mowgli strokes and kisses his five-metre long pet, a giant Burmese python. Seven-year old Sambath rides, wrestles and even sleeps with a snake big enough to squeeze a man to death.

It survives on a diet of four chickens a week, yet giant pythons have been known to eat their owners. &quot;Since the snake has been in our house we've been safe,&quot; says Sambath's mother who tenderly washes the python, which was just the size of a thumb when it first crawled into the family home.<br /><br />Like us on Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/journeymanpictures">https://www.facebook.com/journeymanpictures</a><br />Follow us on Twitter:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JourneymanNews">https://twitter.com/JourneymanNews</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JourneymanVOD">https://twitter.com/JourneymanVOD</a><br />Follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/journeymanpictures">https://instagram.com/journeymanpictures</a><br /><br />For downloads and more information visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://journeyman.tv/59122/short-films/snake-boy.html">http://journeyman.tv/59122/short-films/snake-boy.html</a><br /><br />ABC Australia - Ref. 4177<br /><br />Journeyman Pictures is your independent source for the world's most powerful films, exploring the burning issues of today.
