HR Basics is a series of short courses, designed to highlight what you need to know about a particular human resource management topic. In todayâ€™s HR Basics, we explore employee safety and security, how we keep employees from harm in the workplace.<br /><br />Workplace safety and security refers to the actions taken by the employer to prevent harm to people at work.<br /><br />The Safety and Security function deals with both enterprise and employee safety and security. It includes the organization's efforts to prevent and mitigate loss, risks to or from personnel, threats to its physical assets, damage to its technology and intellectual property, or risks of any other kind arising from all elements surrounding the work environment.<br /><br />Workplace safety and security is effective only when programs, policies and procedures achieve their stated objectives - to prevent harm to people, property and the environment. Best practices vary depending on the scope of the specific safety and security measures.<br /><br />Safety and Security encompasses two overlapping areas of practice. In the following discussion, safety and security issues are sometimes treated separately and are sometimes combined, as appropriate. Workplace safety is a process that seeks to eliminate or reduce risks of injury or illness to employees. The chief aim of workplace security is to protect employees from internal and external security risks. <br /><br />At the end of the day, effective workplace safety and security means everyone goes home.
