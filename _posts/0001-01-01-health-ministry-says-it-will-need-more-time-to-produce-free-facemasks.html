The permanent secretary in the ministry of health has said government will not be able to procure and distribute the over 30 million facemasks to be given to each Ugandan above the age of 6 in fulfillment of one of the prerequisites for further easing of restrictions put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19.<br />Dr. Diana Atwiine says it will take at least one month for government to produce and distribute the facemasks due to delays in procuring suitable manufacturers.<br />During his 14th National Address on government's COVID-19 response, President Museveni said services like public transport would only resume after every Ugandan had been given a face mask.<br />#NTVNews <br /><br />Subscribe to Our Channel<br />For more news visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ntv.co.ug">http://www.ntv.co.ug</a><br />Follow us on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/ntvuganda">http://www.twitter.com/ntvuganda</a><br />Connect with us on Messenger via m.me/NTVUganda
