How much $$$$ a day trader makes in a day ???<br /><br />This video is about an average day of my life being as a Day Trader trading in Australian Stock Exchange. Ever since I had landed in Australia, I have been trading as a retail stock trader. I trade stocks from small cap (penny stocks) to mid cap and large cap blue chip stocks. This pandemic crisis.....just whatever has news catalyst and volatility, I am looking my fortune to become a successful trader. During mid day market hours when stocks are just consolidating, I watch youtube, engage in social medias and  drive out to get some fresh air lol. And yes, in my upcoming days, I would be sharing my knowledge about how to start investing in stock market with the small capital.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: <br />Trading stock can be risky and potentially profitable for a disciplined investors. I am not a licensed financial adviser and It is imperative that you conduct your own research before investing. <br /><br />ðŸ“‰Trading Broker Platforms: <br />Selfwealth (Best broker for Beginners): Free registration fee.
