Continued from &quot;Craigmillar Castle - Part 1&quot;<br /><br />Just 3 miles from Edinburgh's city centre, Craigmillar Castle is often overlooked, but definitely worth the visit. It is one of Scotland's best-preserved historic buildings. The land was acquired by Simon de Preston in 1374 and the oldest building, the tower house, is dated from anywhere between the late 1300s and late 1400s.<br />Craigmillar Castle also holds a special place in the hearts of my two oldest sisters and my uncle, who played freely within its walls as children. What a wonderful playground it would have made!<br /><br /><br /><br />Note: Please excuse the muffled, Darth Vader aspects of my voice while I was inside the castle as I was wearing a face mask.
