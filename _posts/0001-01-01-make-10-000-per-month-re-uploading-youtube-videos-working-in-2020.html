I lay everything out completely step-by-step and each resource/tool I talk about in the video is linked above just in case you want to come back later and easily access them :-)<br /><br />Before we get started, I have to mention how silly some people are - I see so many comments on videos I've made similar to this saying that you can't monetize this type of content... but I show you proof inside the video that their comments are completely false... you just gotta do it properly (which I'll show how).<br /><br />First, you would have to create your channel. For this type of channel I would suggest making a brand name with keywords in it rather than using your own personal name like I do. You do this for 2 reasons. 1, people instantly know what your channel is about and 2, you could sell this channel later on for BIG BUCKS because it isn’t linked to any one person. (The link to my free course that shows how to do all this is above.)<br /><br />Second, we are going to get the content ready. These types of videos are actually super easy to create once you know how - I suggest using the 3 stock footage sites I linked above to get the content together. As for the background music, YouTube Audio Library is the BEST resource for this, hands down!<br /><br />Third, we are going to edit the audio and video together. There are many video editors out there, free &amp; paid. iMovie is by far the best free option, windows free option sucks... so if you can't afford a paid option, check out OpenShot. For paid options, Filmora &amp; Camtasia are the best. You can get free trials above and see which you like more (that's what I did) and I ended up picking Camtasia. And don't worry, I show you how to edit everything together - it's super simple. :-)<br /><br />Fourth, we are going to get our affiliate links. This is a special link we use for a business model called affiliate marketing. That's where you just promote someone else's product that is already created... and THEY deal with all the customer support, order fulfillment (if any), payment processing, etc. Then, when someone purchases after clicking your affiliate link... YOU get a commission - it’s literally the most simple way to make money with YouTube. <br /><br />The hard part is finding a good affiliate program, but I've already done that for you! And this program can be used in almost any country, even India and the Philippines. It's actually on an affiliate network called ClickBank and it's completely free to use! They have tons of products on there (not all of them are good) but I found one that is not only selling like hotcakes - but it’s absolutely perfect for this type of channel. So all you have to do now is get your link, shorten the link, add it to your description... and let the money start rolling in!<br /><br />But now, I told you that I have a bonus for you at the end of the video... so if you want to access the program I personally use to make high ticket affiliate commissions ($1000+) click the link below to get access for just $7:<br /><br />HERE ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.thomasgaretz.com/start-here">https://go.thomasgaretz.com/start-here</a><br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />Some of the links in this video/description may be affiliate links.
