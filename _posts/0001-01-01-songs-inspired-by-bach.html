Sometimes the fact that a song was influenced by Bach is impossible to miss. But other times it's so subtle that you would only know if the songwriter actually admitted that Bach was the kicking-off point for their tune.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Paul Simon interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qFt0cP-klQI">https://youtu.be/qFt0cP-klQI</a><br />Paul McCartney interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BpWHJkEosAA">https://youtu.be/BpWHJkEosAA</a><br />Carl Wilson interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mrgjB7MxgJo">https://youtu.be/mrgjB7MxgJo</a><br />Ron Altbach interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-SVB-EvYtNw">https://youtu.be/-SVB-EvYtNw</a><br /><br />An extra special thanks goes to Glen, Vidad Flowers, Bruce Mount, Toot &amp; Paul Peijzel, the channelâ€™s Patreon saints! ðŸ˜‡<br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/davidbennettpiano">https://www.patreon.com/davidbennettpiano</a>
