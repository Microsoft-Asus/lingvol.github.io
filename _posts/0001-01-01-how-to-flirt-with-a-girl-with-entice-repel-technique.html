There's really no two ways about it!<br /><br />So where do you start then? Well, there are just so many &quot;Pickup Artist&quot; (PUA) and seduction ebooks out there, but let's face it, they are all pretty crap. I know, because I've pretty much gone through enough of those pickup and seduction ebooks, and I never gotten anywhere until I found this technique called &quot;ENTICE + REPEL&quot;.<br /><br />➤➤(Before anything, please press LIKE so that I am encouraged to produce more of these videos for you. Thanks buddy!)<br /><br />First of all, here's a disclaimer: I didn't invent this technique. In fact, I learned it from Derek Rake, the founder of Shogun Method.<br /><br />In this video, I'll show you what &quot;ENTICE + REPEL&quot; is, and how you can use it to flirt with a girl and make her fall in love with you. It's pretty awesome!<br /><br />Don't forget to keep watching until the end where you'll learn some advanced stuff where you'll &quot;implant&quot; a thought inside a woman's mind. Kinda cool. :)<br /><br />Comment below after you complete watching the video and let me know what you think!<br /><br />For more mind control based seduction and emotional enslavement techniques, go to –<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://FractionationHypnosis.com/">http://FractionationHypnosis.com/</a><br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Fredo H.<br /><br />PS: Click “LIKE”, ok?
