{% raw %}Fast and highly accurate with repeatable and reproducible measurements for metrology applications in the manufacturing of a wide variety of products such as PCBs, semiconductors and consumer electronics.<br /><br />CyberCMM™, a comprehensive software suite of coordinate measurement tools that provides highly accurate, 100% metrology-grade measurement on all critical points much faster than a traditional CMM, including coplanarity, distance, height and datum X, Y to name a few. A fast and easy set-up can be performed in less than an hour for programming complex applications as compared to slow, engineering resource-intensive set-up that typically requires multiple adjustments with traditional coordinate measurement machines (CMM)s. Offering unmatched accuracy with the advanced MRS technology that meticulously identifies and rejects reflections caused by shiny components -  making MRS an ideal technology solution for a wide range of applications including those with very high quality requirements.<br /><br />Learn more about the systems:<br />SQ3000 Multi-Function: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CO-SQ3000-Multi">https://bit.ly/CO-SQ3000-Multi</a><br />SQ3000 CMM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CO-SQ3000-CMM">https://bit.ly/CO-SQ3000-CMM</a><br /><br />Learn more about the software:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CO-CyberCMM">https://bit.ly/CO-CyberCMM</a><br /><br />Contact CyberOptics:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cyberoptics.com">http://www.cyberoptics.com</a> <br />info@cyberoptics.com{% endraw %}
