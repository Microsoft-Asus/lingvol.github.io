{% raw %}It's looking less and less likely that Apple’s next halo-level iPhone, the iPhone 8 or Edition or iPhone 10, will have a print reader under the full-coverage front OLED display screen – or anywhere at all. According to BGR, the reason might be that Apple has yet to perfect the tech needed to make it work reliably, at least for now, and perhaps for another reason as well.<br /><br />Apple isn’t making the OLED screens for new iPhone, Samsung is, and that creates a problem of sorts. As you can imagine, Apple and Samsung are fierce competitors with each other, but, they are also joined at the hip when it comes to display technologies, since Samsung is making the OLED screens for Apple’s iPhones. It’s like having a rich uncle you hate but still have to be nice to during the holidays. It’s complicated.<br /><br />Anyway, according to reliable Apple tech prognosticator Ming-Chi Kuo, no sub-screen print reader on the new iPhone means Samsung doesn’t have to produce that tech, and as such, won’t have to maybe copy it and add it to their next halo phone, the Galaxy S9, in order to stay even with Apple. Anyway, rumor suggests Apple is going all-in on face-reading tech since it is supposedly more secure, but that also sorta lets Samsung off the hook to “keep up” as well.<br /><br />So, will the Apple iPhone 8 have a print reader… anywhere? Looks more and more like it won’t, which will be a major change for the iPhone. But, that’s what technical problems can result in sometimes.
