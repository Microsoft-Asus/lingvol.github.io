But, despite its name, flies aren't the flytrap's only meal. As long as its prey is roughly the right size and touches two of its hairs within twenty seconds, the plant will dine on any insect or spider that comes its way.<br /><br />Glands in the lobes then secrete enzymes that break the dinner down into a digestible soup. Ten days later, the trap pops open to reveal nothing but a dried out husk.<br /><br />David Attenborough looks at the extraordinary ends to which animals and plants go in order to survive. Featuring epic spectacles, amazing TV firsts and examples of new wildlife behaviour.<br /><br />Life | BBC<br /><br />#DavidAttenborough #Life #BBC<br />All our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.
