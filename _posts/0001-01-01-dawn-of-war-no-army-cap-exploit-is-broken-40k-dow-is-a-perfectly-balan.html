Dawn Of War is the classic Warhammer 40k RTS game which features all of the greatest factions! Like Orks, Orks, Orks, Orks, Tau and Space marines. Now today the spiffing brit will be playing 40k DoW to see if it is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the No army cap exploit is broken! I mean why would an infinite army of orks that outnumber the enemy 50 to 1 be consider overpowered! Now I am a huge fan of the dawn of war series. Well all the variations and mods of the first game! Today we will be playing Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade however I strongly recommend picking up the slightly more modern and balanced rts game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm. If you do get back into the game make sure to pickup the ultimate apocalypse mod to really experience the true 40k universe! <br /><br />So sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the No Army Cap Exploit IS BROKEN!! <br /><br />What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold in a funny montage with glitches and funny moments. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. <br /><br />Magestic Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit">https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing">https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing</a><br />Twitter: @thespiffingbrit<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/spiffing">https://discord.gg/spiffing</a><br /><br />Title: Dawn Of War No Army Cap Exploit IS BROKEN - 40k DoW  is a Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits<br /><br />#DawnOfWar #DoW #Exploit
