Watching the grace, power and honesty of dance, you can't help but feel completely inspired. You let the rest of the world disappear and you are frozen in that moment of time. Eila is an incredible individual and talented dancer in NYC. These are her moments.<br /><br />&quot;You need to fight your demons, break your comfort zones. That's what you do if you want to grow...if you want to keep getting better.&quot;<br /><br />Dancer: Eila Valls<br />Gibney Studios<br />Music: Tony Anderson<br /><br />www.wiimixfilms.com<br /><br />Update: I was fortunate enough to work with Eila again (1 year later and this time with her boyfriend) for a wonderfully choreographed piece of dance we're calling &quot;Within Reach&quot;. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fSBWjrPRQo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fSBWjrPRQo</a><br />#dancefilm #filmmaking #contemporary
