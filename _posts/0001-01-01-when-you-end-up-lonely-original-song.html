Hey sweet honey <br />It’s nice to see you again <br />Funny how we still act like lovers <br />After saying we’d be friends <br /><br />Show me a little affection honey<br />Show me a little love <br />I don’t think you’ll ever meet anyone <br />Who’ll give you more than I have done <br />When you end up lonely baby<br />And by your side you have no one <br />You’ll realize how much I gave <br />And you’ll miss how much I loved <br />You’ll miss how much I loved<br /><br />I think you just don’t know what you want <br />Or maybe you’re just scared <br />But who doesn’t want somebody to love <br />Someone who when you need them is there <br /><br />Chorus <br /><br />You better make your mind up quickly <br />Because soon I’ll be gone <br />I don’t think I can spend a whole lifetime <br />Waiting on someone<br /><br />Chorus
