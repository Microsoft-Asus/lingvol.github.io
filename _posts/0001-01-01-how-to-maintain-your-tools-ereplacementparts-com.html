A nice set of tools can be a huge investment, so it makes sense that you would want them to look and perform their best. Unfortunately, improper storage and neglect can cause them to break down and show wear prematurely. Luckily, maintaining your tools is an easy process, and can not only prolong their life, but help make your projects and repairs that much easier as well.<br /><br />In this video, we’ll share 3 helpful tips for maintaining your tools, so you don’t need to constantly replace them, and they won’t let you down when you need them!<br /><br />Let us know what steps you take to maintain YOUR tools in the comments section below!<br /><br />3 SIMPLE WAYS TO MAINTAIN YOUR TOOLS:<br /><br />#1 – Carefully Inspect Your Tools Before Each Use (0:19)<br />Using a damaged tool can be quite dangerous. Watch out for things like rusty blades, exposed wires, and cracked handles before you get your project started. It’s also important that you make any necessary repairs before the project. If your power tool needs a replacement part, you can find one quickly at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ereplacementparts.com/power-tool-parts.html.">https://www.ereplacementparts.com/power-tool-parts.html.</a><br /><br />#2 – Clean Your Tools After Every Use (0:44)<br />This may seem like a no-brainer but cleaning your tools after each time you use them will help them last a lot longer and will prevent problems like rusting metal. This can save you time and money down the road. <br /><br />Cleaning your tools is simple, and typically won’t require anything more than rag and some soapy water. Another helpful tip is to ensure your tools are properly dried before you store them. Giving metal parts a once-over with some WD-40 can help prevent rust, and linseed oil works wonders on wooden handles.<br /><br />For power tools, you’ll want to give them a little extra effort. Compressed air can blast away dust and debris and lubricating moving parts before storage can help them in the long-run. A cotton swab with alcohol can also help keep your battery contacts clean. <br /><br />Cleaning your tools after each use will keep them looking great, but it will also allow you to do a thorough inspection of the tool and help prevent any more serious issues.<br /><br />#3 – Store Your Tools Properly (2:06)<br />Water and humidity are the enemy! Try to avoid humid locations wherever you can and storing your tools with silica gel packs can help protect them from moisture. You’ll want to store your power tools in their original plastic cases and store them somewhere secure. <br /><br />It can be tempting to just leave your tools on the work bench when you’re done with them, and start relaxing, but it’s not a great idea. Store your tools on peg boards, or in tool boxes, shelves, or cabinets to keep your workshop tidy and prevent any accidental damage or wear to the tools.<br /><br />************************************************************************************************************<br />Did you find this video helpful?
