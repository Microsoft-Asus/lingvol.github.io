Quick video demonstrating how using abbreviations can make understanding and reading back ATC instructions very simple. I used an IFR clearance from one of my older videos as an example. I've been asked about remembering and/or reading back ATC instructions a lot, so hopefully this is helpful. Thanks for watching.
