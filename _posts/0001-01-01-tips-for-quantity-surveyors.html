This video provides insight into things I’ve learnt along the way being a Quantity Surveyor (QS) and also about the construction industry in general.<br /><br />This isn’t information you’re taught at university but knowledge you pick up and hone once you start doing the role.<br /><br />Some of the points are industry insights whilst others are probably quirks of how I process things to perform a task quicker or better.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy learning about these 6 tips and hopefully at least a couple will help you out in the future.<br /><br />Please like and subscribe to the channel.
