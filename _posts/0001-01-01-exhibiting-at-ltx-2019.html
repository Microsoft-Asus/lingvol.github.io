I'm back and here's what it was like to exhibit my vintage computers at LTX 2019!<br /><br /><br />This was a wild ride that took so long to plan but was over so quickly once it started. It was extremely rewarding and I am grateful for the opportunity I was given by everyone at Linus Media Group to do this.<br /><br />Booth tour with Gamers Nexus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87ALbovM5q0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87ALbovM5q0</a><br /><br />This is a completely new type of video for me to make so you'll have to forgive any oddities with it. There are many aspects of editing this that were firsts for me, music segments, cropped to camera parts, vlogging, and filming away from my set in general. <br /><br /><br />Other Links<br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/AkBKukU">https://www.youtube.com/AkBKukU</a><br />Github: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/AkBKukU">https://github.com/AkBKukU</a><br />Thingiverse: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/AkBKukU">https://www.thingiverse.com/AkBKukU</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AkBKukU">https://www.patreon.com/AkBKukU</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/E6xgGs6">https://discord.gg/E6xgGs6</a>
