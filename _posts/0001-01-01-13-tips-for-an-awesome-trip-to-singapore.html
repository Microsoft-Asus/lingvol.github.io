Known as the “Lion City,” join me as I explore the what to do, where to go, and what to eat in the incredible city of Singapore.<br /><br />Follow Me:<br />Intstagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mattstraveltips/">https://www.instagram.com/mattstraveltips/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MattsTravelTips/">https://www.facebook.com/MattsTravelTips/</a><br /><br />Huge thanks to the Singapore Tourism Board:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/">https://www.stb.gov.sg/</a><br /><br />FEATURED IN THIS VIDEO:<br /><br />Hotels:<br />-Hotel 81 (multiple locations…good budget hotel options. Not fancy, but clean with a private bathroom)<br />-Beary Best! Hostel (Chinatown)<br /><br />Food:<br />Below are some of my favorite places…all highly recommended, but honestly…the key is to find a stall with a long line of locals…that’s the best indication of what’s good. It’ll be worth waiting for:)<br /><br />Featured Hawker Centres:<br />-Maxwell Food Centre<br />-Old Airport Road Food Centre<br />-Chinatown Complex<br />-Tiong Bahru Market<br />-Lau Pa Sat Food Court (Specifically the satay stalls on the street outside the main centre)<br />-Chinatown Food Street<br /><br />Featured Food Stalls:<br />Maxwell Food Centre:<br />-Ah Tai Chicken Rice (THE BEST)<br />-Tian Tian Chicken Rice<br />-Zhen Zhen Porridge<br />-Marina Bay Delicious Foods (Get their Char Kway Teow) <br /><br />Old Airport Road:<br />-Roast Paradise (Char Su with Pork Rice)<br />-Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong Lor Mee<br /><br />Chomp Chomp Food Centre:<br />-Ah Hok Fried Hokkien Noodles (there can be a long wait for this stall)<br />-Hai Wai Yuan BBQ (Sambal stingray)<br /><br />Chinatown Complex:<br />-Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice (Mixed claypot)<br />-Jia Ji Mei Shi (Get the Chee Cheong Fun)<br />-Hawker Stan (There will be a long line starting before 10AM)<br /><br />Lau Pa Sat:<br />-Stall 8 on Satay street (Stall #8 is by far the best of them)<br /><br />Little India:<br />-Komala Vilas Vegetarian Restaurant (Order anything and everything…but I come here for the Dosai…but seriously…everything is amazing)<br />-Jaggi’s Northern Indian Cuisine (Again…everything is incredible. I love the butter chicken, and make sure to get some of their incredible made-to-order naan bread)<br /><br />Tiong Bahru:<br />-Loo’s Hainanese Curry Rice (just…friggin’ delicious. Definitely go here if you’re in Tiong Bahru)<br />Tiong Bahru Bakery (Everything here is great…the croissants in particular are flaky and perfect)<br /><br />Spago:<br />Top of Tower 2 at Marina Bay Sands. Good drinks and very good food…great views of the city. The menu is super spendy.  But it’s one of the best burgers in the city.<br /><br />THINGS TO DO:<br />-Gardens By the Bay<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en.html">http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en.html</a><br />-Singapore Botanic Gardens (&amp; Orchid Garden)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg">https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg</a><br />-Marina Bay Sands<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.marinabaysands.com">https://www.marinabaysands.com</a><br />-Sentosa<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sentosa.com.sg">https://www.sentosa.com.sg</a><br />-Lazarus Island (catch the Ferry to St. John’s Island at the Marina South Pier and walk to Lazarus…follow the signs to the beach.

And of course…there’s always AirBnB)
