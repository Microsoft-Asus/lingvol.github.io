A high gain comparison of the 8 different Celestion speakers I own.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> The first in the mix sound comparison has a low pass and high pass filter on guitar tracks. The comparison you hear after that doesn't have anything else involved. It's the dry tone coming out of the microphone.
