How hopeful can we be on an European, enlightened version of Islam? Is that something Muslims themselves actually want? And will it be possible to overcome the Europeans’ distrust of Islam?<br /><br />Jan Leyers goes in search of answers. He heads off to Sarajevo, Budapest, Vienna, Hamburg, Paris, London, Copenhagen and Malmö. He listens to the voice of experts and the word on the street and talks with religious men and women, with ex-believers and new converts. What do they hope for and what are their concerns? In this series, Jan stays true to his style: nuanced and respectful, without shying away from controversy.
