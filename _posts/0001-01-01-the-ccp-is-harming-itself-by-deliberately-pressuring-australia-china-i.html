However, American companies and consumers themselves are affected by the soaring prices of goods. Therefore, SMH believes that China's ban on Australian goods will have the same effect.<br /><br />Australia is one of the major trading partners of China because it is considered reliable, has high quality products and competitive prices. Take coke coal for example. Australia currently supplies about half of the metallurgical coal to Chinese steel mills. Although China has a huge domestic coal industry, its steel mills still need premium coal produced by Australia.<br />Since Beijing first passed a ban on Canberra coal, about 7 million tons of coal estimated to be worth $ 700 million have been trapped and unloaded at Chinese ports. Australia's export coke price has dropped to about 100 USD / ton, the lowest level in 4 years and nearly 30% lower than the price 2 months ago.<br /><br />China says the restrictions on Australian coal imports are due to the fact that many Australian producers &quot;fail to meet environmental standards&quot;. Apparently this ban is hurting Australia. But the Chinese side was also affected more than once when the domestic coal price surged, doubling the imported coal price, while China imported US and Canadian coke to replace Australia with the soaring price.<br />As a result, Chinese steel mills pay more for lower quality coal, resulting in reduced productivity, more environmentally toxic emissions, and poorer quality products. .<br /><br />To punish Australia, China is harming the competitiveness of the domestic steel industry by giving competitors access to higher quality raw materials at lower prices that meet environmental standards. of Japan, Korea and India.<br /><br />Another example is the high tax imposed on Australian wine by China because of &quot;dumping&quot;. Australia is China's largest wine exporter. A 169.3% tariff on Australian wines, even up to 200%, would make them less available on the mainland market, thereby reducing Chinese consumer choice.
