We don't always realize it but it is often in very small moments that people decide whether they like us or whether they don't and that is why in this video, I want to give you 6 things that you can use to make people like you immediately. Starting with the first one, a very specific type of compliment because you're not going to compliment people on what they have, you're going to compliment people on what they've earned and worked for. <br /><br />The truth about compliments is, yes, it feels amazing when people compliment us; of course, we like that. But when it comes to compliments, it often turns out to be that people are hearing the same ones over and over. For instance, maybe they have really nice eyes or they have a good sense of style and when they start to hear that over and over, it can become something that doesn't mean much to them. If you can be the person that finds out what they are working on and notices that while they're still working and struggling and then compliments them on that, it will hit them so hard. <br /><br />0:19 Compliment people on what they've earned<br />2:05 Get them to talk about what they love<br />3:09 Share a truth that is to your detriment<br />4.56 Open body language<br />5:47 Exceed expectations without asking permission<br />7:46 Be the first person to joke<br /><br />Connect With Us Further:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.charismaoncommand.com">http://www.charismaoncommand.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/charismaoncommand">http://facebook.com/charismaoncommand</a><br />Instagram: @CharismaOnCommand{% endraw %}
