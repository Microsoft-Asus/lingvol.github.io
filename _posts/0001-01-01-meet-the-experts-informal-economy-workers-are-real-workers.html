{% raw %}Informality is found in both the traditional informal economy and – increasingly – through the growth of informality in the formal sector. Aya Matsuura, Chief Technical Advisor of Way out of Informality project, talks of the varied challenges for workers in the informal economy who despite contributing to local economies often go unrecognized and excluded from labour laws.
