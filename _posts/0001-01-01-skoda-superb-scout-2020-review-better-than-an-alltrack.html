The Skoda Superb Scout is a large station wagon that has a small suspension lift over a regular Superb estate. It also has AWD and a powerful 200kW / 270 hp two-litre turbo petrol engine, making it surprisingly fast! The Superb Scout is very practical and good-looking to our eyes. In some ways, it's better than its Volkswagen Passat Alltrack cousin. But would you have a Superb over a Kodiaq SUV?
