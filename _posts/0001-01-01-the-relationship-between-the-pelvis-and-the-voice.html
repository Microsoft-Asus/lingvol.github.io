This clip is from Embodied Anatomy: The Dynamics of Vocalization with Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen.<br /><br />The full video is available at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bonniebainbridgecohen.com/collections/embodied-anatomy-videos/products/dynamics-of-vocalization.">https://bonniebainbridgecohen.com/collections/embodied-anatomy-videos/products/dynamics-of-vocalization.</a><br /><br />The Dynamics of Vocal Expression presents unique and effective Body-Mind Centering® principles for working with your voice. The expressive qualities of our voice communicate to others who we are. Bringing kinesthetic and auditory awareness to our vocal structures allows us to better embody, articulate and balance them. This process opens pathways of expression between our unconscious and conscious mind and between ourselves and others. <br /><br />Material covers: <br />•  Gaining awareness of your own patterns of vocalization and <br />    facilitating repatterning in others<br />•   Using spatial planes and vowel scales in shaping your pharynx <br />    for clear overtones and vowel production<br />•   Distinguishing the production of pitch and intensity in your <br />     larynx (vocal cartilages and vocal diaphragm)<br />•   Remembering your embryological development as it relates to <br />    voice<br />•   Recognizing the psychophysical aspects of breathing and <br />    vocalization<br /><br />The Body-Mind Centering® approach to Embodied Anatomy is a deep, internal study of the body in which movement and consciousness are explored through the direct experience of our own body systems, tissues and cells. The principles of Embodied Anatomy can be applied to any type of movement, bodywork, therapy or other body-mind discipline. Shot at workshops with Bonnie, these DVDs are a great way to immerse yourself in an aspect of Bonnie's work and get a new perspective on movement, the body and the mind.<br /><br />For information about the Body-Mind Centering® approach and School for Body-Mind Centering® programs and courses, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bodymindcentering.com.">https://www.bodymindcentering.com.</a>
