Are you #MechanicallyInclined or #MechanicallyDeclined, how to tell and what to do about it.<br /><br />In my experience there are very few totally mechanically Inclined or Declined people. No matter what gender, region, nationality or economic background they come from. Almost anyone can learn how to make things, repair things, improve things, improvise solutions or just Mac Gyver the project. And everyone at some time will make some mistake, break something, scratch something, use the wrong tool and have to do it over, or just find what they made didn't do what they wanted.<br /><br />So you're now asking yourself, “how do I know what I can do?”.

I could end this video at this point because, many will just say no I can't, and just skip it, spend money to buy it or replace it or hire someone to do it for them. Instead I want to help you to look at yourself honestly, to see if you can do the project even though it won't be perfect, but you will have learned something, and you can point to the things you did right with a level of pride.<br /><br />First no one is perfect, I can guarantee that even experts who have been doing things for years will make mistakes, they're just better at minimizing the occasional error.<br /><br />Now I am going to state that there are some who I wouldn't let near a tool, ever. They have skills that make them talented in other areas but for projects that require some ability to put things together, they are hazardous to themselves and everyone around them. You may be saying “that's me” , but is it? This can only be established by trying smaller safer tasks and seeing the results. Then you can see what your skill levels are currently, and where you need to learn more.<br /><br />My mother taught me a valuable lesson in learning how to do something, don't be afraid to ask for directions. Back in the 1940's she had a car that needed to be reupholstered, she had no money for the task but she asked questions of the professionals, and they gave her some basic directions. Her existing talents in sewing and the directions given allowed her to do such an exceptional job that the same professionals offered her a job when they saw her work. She learned by doing.<br /><br />videos referenced:<br /><br />DIY – Adding Driveway Lights<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JgAh7o25GJQ">https://youtu.be/JgAh7o25GJQ</a><br />RV DIY Replacing the Dinette Part 3 Building The Cabinet<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mDFNjIiyEMk">https://youtu.be/mDFNjIiyEMk</a><br />Making Tools On The Fly - Part 1 - Router Table<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ntERM-eXO-A">https://youtu.be/ntERM-eXO-A</a><br />DIY Replacing Front Disc Brake Pads and Rotors<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/yi8EctiFLzM">https://youtu.be/yi8EctiFLzM</a><br />RV DIY - Water Heater Replacement<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DYA1pwUFAJc">https://youtu.be/DYA1pwUFAJc</a><br />Helping Friends Learn - Basic Car Maintenance - Air Filter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5wbgyZOppoY">https://youtu.be/5wbgyZOppoY</a><br />How To Basic Vacuum Cleaner Maintenance<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xpGd57rOJIQ">https://youtu.be/xpGd57rOJIQ</a><br />Do It Yourself - Tips and Tricks Headlight Restoration On a Budget<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tyD5OWo344s">https://youtu.be/tyD5OWo344s</a><br /> All of the videos referenced here are in the description below.<br />Simple projects need simple tools, so this is the time to start your tool collection. In many of our videos the tools needed are described, and this is how your tool collection begins. Some videos even look at specific basic tools. In future videos I'll take you through more of the basic tools, as well as the ones that are more specialized, and some storage ideas that keep tools where you need them, having these tools can give you confidence in tackling both simple and challenging projects.<br />Roof Maintenance Basic Tools<br />RV DIY Roof Maintenance - Basic Tools<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fwRHGKSvvbw">https://youtu.be/fwRHGKSvvbw</a><br />Screwdriver basics<br />DIY Basics - Working With Tools - Screwdrivers<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JxVAonQRva4">https://youtu.be/JxVAonQRva4</a><br /><br />One other way to get practice especially on car or truck repair is to go to a self service salvage yard and practice removing parts on the cars there. There is a bonus to this, you may find the part you need at a greatly reduced price.<br /><br />This is #HowWeDoIt to make videos and the tools we use:<br /><br />Cameras: <br />#Samsung smart phones J7<br />#yi M1 mirrorless camera with 12 - 40 mm  lens<br /><br />Video Editing:<br />Software:<br />Open Office<br />#Filmora<br />GIMP 2<br />Hardware:<br />Dell Inspiron 5570, 16 GB RAM
