You're going to get clear explanations and lots of examples.<br /><br />THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TENSES<br /><br />The past simple is used for actions that finished in the past and have no connection to the present.<br /><br />The present perfect is used for actions that haven't finished.<br /><br />The example I gave is this:<br /><br />- My grandma never went to Madrid<br />- Paul has never been to Madrid<br /><br />My grandma died a long time ago. Therefore, the action of her (possibly) going to Madrid is over.<br /><br />Paul is still alive. The action of him going or not going to Madrid continues.<br /><br />We use the simple past with past time expressions. This includes:<br /><br />- I went there YESTERDAY<br />- She told me TWO HOURS AGO<br />- They went to London IN 2002<br /><br />Present time expressions are more difficult. What tense you use depends on what you're talking about.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />- I've had a great day (in general)<br />- I had a great day today (talking about work that has now finished)<br /><br />The present perfect is stricter in British English. For example:<br /><br />- Did you have breakfast yet? (you'll hear this in American English)<br />- Have you had breakfast yet? (only in British English)<br /><br />USING THE PRESENT PERFECT WITH JUST<br /><br />- I just saw her (American English)<br />- I've just seen her (British English)<br /><br />OTHER ENGLISH LESSONS RELATED ON THIS TOPIC:<br /><br />- Present perfect simple vs continuous: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oODlA-r7HU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oODlA-r7HU</a><br /><br />For vs Since: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTddHN6ipmc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTddHN6ipmc</a><br /><br />Been to vs been in: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIl5hOQ5i-A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIl5hOQ5i-A</a><br /><br />Present perfect with just: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPVImrOmxA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPVImrOmxA</a><br /><br />Present perfect in the negative: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3nx11zwhGU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3nx11zwhGU</a><br /><br />Also, watch this video to learn more differences between British and American English: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rtbvqb-_1E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rtbvqb-_1E</a><br /><br />ENGLISH FLUENCY PROGRAM:<br /><br />My program gives you the method that will dramatically improve your speaking, grammar, and pronunciation and the materials you need to follow this method.<br /><br />This method works and if you are ready to FINALLY speak English with confidence, I would love to have you.<br /><br />Learn more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tofluency.com/tfp/">https://www.tofluency.com/tfp/</a><br />Sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tofluency.samcart.com/products/join-tfp">https://tofluency.samcart.com/products/join-tfp</a><br /><br />COMMON QUESTIONS:<br /><br />Q: Where are you from? <br />A: I grew up in Preston, Lancashire, England.<br /><br />Q: How long have you been teaching?<br />A: I've been teaching English since 2011.
