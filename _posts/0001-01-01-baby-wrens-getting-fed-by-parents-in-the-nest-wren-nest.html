Wrens are a family of brown passerine birds in the predominantly New World family Troglodytidae. The family includes 88 species divided into 19 genera. Only the Eurasian wren occurs in the Old World, where, in Anglophone regions, it is commonly known simply as the &quot;wren&quot;, as it is the originator of the name. The name wren has been applied to other, unrelated birds, particularly the New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) and the Australian wrens (Maluridae).<br /><br />Most wrens are small and inconspicuous (being, in fact, the shortest bird in England) though they have loud and often complex songs. Exceptions include the relatively large members of the genus Campylorhynchus, which can be quite bold in their behavior. Wrens have short wings that are barred in most species, and they often hold their tails upright. Wrens are primarily insectivorous, eating insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates, but many species also eat vegetable matter and some eat small frogs and lizards.<br /><br />Distribution and habitat:<br />Wrens are principally a New World family, distributed from Alaska and Canada to southern Argentina, with the greatest species richness in the Neotropics. As suggested by its name, the Eurasian wren is the only species of wren found outside the Americas, as restricted to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa (it was formerly considered conspecific with the winter wren and Pacific wren of North America). The insular species include the Clarión wren and Socorro wren from the Revillagigedo Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and Cobb's wren in the Falkland Islands, but few Caribbean islands have a species of wren, with only the southern house wren in the Lesser Antilles, the Cozumel wren of Cozumel Island, and the highly restricted Zapata wren in a single swamp in Cuba.<br /><br />The various species occur in a wide range of habitats, ranging from dry, sparsely wooded country to rainforests. Most species are mainly found at low levels, but members of the genus Campylorhynchus are frequently found higher, and the two members of Odontorchilus are restricted to the forest canopy. A few species, notably the Eurasian wren and the house wren, are often associated with humans. Most species are resident, remaining in Central and South America all year round, but the few species found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere are partially migratory, spending the winter further south.<br /><br />Taxonomy and systematics:<br />Revised following Martínez Gómez et al. (2005) and Mann et al. (2006), the taxonomy of some groups is highly complex, and future species-level splits are likely. Additionally, undescribed taxa are known to exist. The black-capped donacobius is an enigmatic species traditionally placed with the wrens more for lack of a more apparent alternative than as a result of thorough study. It was recently determined to be most likely closer to certain warblers, possibly the newly established Megaluridae, and might constitute a monotypic family.<br /><br />Family Troglodytidae<br />Genus Campylorhynchus<br />White-headed wren<br />Band-backed wren<br />Grey-barred wren<br />Stripe-backed wren<br />Fasciated wren<br />Giant wren<br />Bicolored wren<br />Veracruz wren<br />Sclater's wren<br />Rufous-backed wren<br />Spotted wren<br />Yucatan wren<br />Boucard's wren<br />Cactus wren<br />Thrush-like wren<br /><br />Grey-mantled wren<br />Genus Odontorchilus<br />Grey-mantled wren<br />Tooth-billed wren<br /><br />Rock wren<br />Genus Salpinctes<br />Rock wren<br /><br />Canyon wren<br />Genus Catherpes<br />Canyon wren <br />Genus Hylorchilus<br />Sumichrast's wren<br />Nava's wren<br />Genus Cinnycerthia<br />Rufous wren<br />Sepia-brown wren<br />Peruvian wren<br />Fulvous wren<br />Genus Cistothorus<br />Sedge wren<br />Mérida wren or paramo wren<br />Apolinar's wren<br />Grass wren<br />Marsh wren<br /><br />Bewick's wren<br />Genus Thryomanes<br />Bewick's wren <br />Genus Ferminia<br />Zapata wren<br /><br />Black-throated wren<br /><br />Happy wren<br />Genus Pheugopedius<br />Black-throated wren<br />Sooty-headed wren<br />Black-bellied wren<br />Plain-tailed wren<br />Inca wren<br />Moustached wren<br />Whiskered wren<br />Coraya wren<br />Happy wren<br />Spot-breasted wren<br />Rufous-breasted wren<br />Speckle-breasted wren<br />Genus Thryophilus<br />Banded wren<br />Rufous-and-white wren<br />Antioquia wren<br />Niceforo's wren<br />Sinaloa wren<br /><br />Bay wren<br /><br />Long-billed wren<br />Genus Cantorchilus<br />Cabanis's wren<br />Canebrake wren<br />Isthmian wren<br />Buff-breasted wren<br />Superciliated wren<br />Fawn-breasted wren<br />Long-billed wren<br />Grey wren<br />Riverside wren<br />Bay wren<br />Stripe-breasted wren<br />Stripe-throated wren<br />Genus Thryothorus<br />Carolina wren<br />White-browed wren<br /><br />Southern house wren<br /><br />Eurasian wren<br />Genus Troglodytes (10–15 species, depending on taxonomy; includes species sometimes considered to be in the genus Nannus, which may be distinct)<br />Eurasian wren<br />Winter wren<br />Pacific wren<br />Clarión wren<br />House wren<br />Cobb's wren<br />Socorro wren<br />Rufous-browed wren<br />Ochraceous wren<br />Mountain wren<br />Santa Marta wren<br />Tepui wren<br />Genus Thryorchilus<br />Timberline wren<br />Genus Uropsila<br />White-bellied wren<br />Genus Henicorhina<br />White-breasted wood wren<br />Grey-breasted wood wren<br />Hermit wood wren – split from H. leucophrys<br />Bar-winged wood wren<br />Munchique wood wren<br />Genus Microcerculus<br />Northern nightingale-wren<br />Southern nightingale-wren
