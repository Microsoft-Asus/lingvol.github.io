The most known 4 Witcher Sets; Ursine, Wolven, Griffin and Feline Witcher gear. I've got them all into grandmaster level, additionality one more Witcher Gear set- that is Manticora Witcher Gear set. That requires really hard work to find a tramendous amount of orens, that is functional currency.  They're all exhibited in the vineyard of Corvo Bianco,  which is the first, and most probably the last house of the White Wolf, Geralt of Rivia or in other words Butcher of Blaviken. In addition, I thought that it would be great if I were to do my best,especially having it fully-equipped with something that's never been seen before for a house like that which had a huge and interesting history.
