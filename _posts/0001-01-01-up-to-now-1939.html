The sequence features an aerial photo gradually becoming unshaded to represent the growth of the Dodge Main plant, as well as an exterior shot of the new Warren Truck Assembly plant.  Further shots follow accenting the external features of the factory building.<br /><br />Next, the film turns its focus to life in 1914, through a dramatization of a family at home in 25 years ago. The father brings home a Dodge Model 30-35 touring car--the company's first car.<br /><br />The history of Dodge print advertising next becomes a focus of the film.  The narrator explains that the tagline in the company's first print advertisement was &quot;It Speaks for Itself,&quot; followed by a list of the car's specifications.  The film also features the ad for the 1917 Dodge &quot;closed car&quot; sedan, &quot;the first all-steel closed car ever built.&quot;  The film also claims that the word &quot;dependability&quot; was introduced in an advertisement for the Dodge Type-A Sedan in 1923.<br /><br />A timeline then quickly rolls listing the introduction years of various Dodge innovations.<br /><br />Scenes of Dodge cars undergoing outdoor tests follow.  A four-door sedan drives across rough terrain, a sedan rolls down the side of a hill, and a two-door sedan drives through thick mud.<br /><br />Next, in a scripted segment, two Dodge workers--Ed and Bill--who have been with the company since 1914 converse about their time with the company.  <br /><br />From the workers, the film then turns to Dodge dealerships.  An honor roll listing dealers who have been with the company for 25 years is shown.<br /><br />Footage of the inner workings of the company follows.  This includes a shot of foundry workers, with an African American worker in the center of the frame, a series of shots of workers retooling factory machines, and a room of designers working at long drafting tables.<br /><br />The film ends with the slogan, &quot;It's Dodge For Mine in '39.&quot;<br /><br />The film is contained on a metal reel, housed within a dark grey metal canister.  A handwritten label reading &quot;Up To Now, 1939 Dodge&quot; is affixed to the inside canisterâ€™s lid.{% endraw %}
