This is how to mirror gaze. If you stare at yourself in the mirror for more than 10 minutes then your mirror gazing experience will start to become more of a soul staring experience where self love and spirituality become a part of what you are doing. Mirror staring is hard to begin with because when you are mirror gazing you have to overcome that inner narrative that is talking to you and taking away your attention. People have different mirror gazing experiences depending on whether you make it your own personal open minded meditation experience or whether you decide to mirror gaze very close minded. After 10 minutes people wonder what will happen if you stare at yourself in the mirror directly gazing into your eyes.<br /><br />Mirror meditation can have many benefits and there are different techniques for doing it. personally, I try to make my mirror gazing experience similar to a mantra meditation where I stare deeply into the glimmer of light within my eyes. This often takes me on a journey through space and time and delivers me to my soul where I often find tranquility and inner peace<br /><br />People often ask if mirror gazing dangerous? I would like to reiterate that you come from the experience very positive but obviously it depends on whether you are open minded or close minded to your mirror gazing/soul staring experience.<br /><br />The power of mirror gazing is within you. This is how to mirro gaze and the benefits of mirror gazing. Mirror gazing benefits are described during the video and this is what will happen if you stare at yourself in the mirror! ðŸ‘€<br /><br />#mirrorgazing #gazing #mirror<br /><br />SUPPORT THE CHANNEL ON PATREON:<br />Get cool channel perks and additional content, whilst supporting the charity ShareTanzania<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/ahelpfulearth">http://www.patreon.com/ahelpfulearth</a><br /><br />GO TO MY WEBSITE:<br />For my life coaching service and pre-made + tailored-made meditations:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ahelpfulearth.com">http://www.ahelpfulearth.com</a><br /><br />FOR CHANNEL MERCH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/ahe-apparel">https://teespring.com/stores/ahe-apparel</a><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />FACEBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ahelpfulearth">https://www.facebook.com/ahelpfulearth</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ahelpfulearth">https://www.instagram.com/ahelpfulearth</a><br /><br />TWITTER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/Ahelpfulearth">https://www.twitter.com/Ahelpfulearth</a>
