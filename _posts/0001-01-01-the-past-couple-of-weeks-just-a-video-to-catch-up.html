Oh hey! It’s been a couple of weeks. This is just a video to catch up. Here is a little of what I’ve been up to.. so many nature walks.. finally got my drone to work... I still have pink hair and I don’t care... I like to dance a lot.. trying to calm my mind during the election.. and when all else fails my dog always cheers me up.<br /><br />This is what November looks like in Delaware. <br /><br />K LATER SKATER. <br /><br />This channel was created so I can practice being as unbothered as a trash panda in a dumpster. <br /><br />My Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alexunbothered/">https://www.instagram.com/alexunbothered/</a><br /><br />If ya dig the vid... subscribe here -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWrEMh4dMwuy9_xKgpH-8Q?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWrEMh4dMwuy9_xKgpH-8Q?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Thanks for stopping by.
