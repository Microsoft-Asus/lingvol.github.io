During this video we specifically talk about antibiotics used in the treatment of pneumonia which may be bacterial, viral, or fungal. We then conclude this discussion by talking about two types of vaccines used in the prevention of pneumonia, and finally, several complications that pneumonia may cause. <br /><br />SUPPORT US!<br /><br />FACEBOOK | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NinjaNerdMedicine">https://www.facebook.com/NinjaNerdMedicine</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ninjanerdmedicine">https://www.instagram.com/ninjanerdmedicine</a><br /><br />GoFundMe | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/ninja-nerd-science">https://www.gofundme.com/ninja-nerd-science</a><br /><br />PATREON | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/NinjaNerdMedicine">https://www.patreon.com/NinjaNerdMedicine</a>
