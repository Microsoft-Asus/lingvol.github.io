{% raw %}Today marks exactly 9 years since I uploaded my first ever video to YouTube. The website sure has changed a lot since then! In this video we look back at a whole bunch of things that have happened since 2011, and I share never before heard stories about some of the events that occurred along the way. Thank you all so much for supporting me over the years. I hope that you enjoy this video! :)<br /><br />Tealgamemaster's channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tealgamemaster">https://www.youtube.com/user/tealgamemaster</a><br />Milesluigi's channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MilesLuigi">https://www.youtube.com/user/MilesLuigi</a><br /><br />Old Room Tour: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCOI19u4Ya8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCOI19u4Ya8</a><br />Pokemon Blue Cheats: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVsFqFdElKA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVsFqFdElKA</a><br />My Game &amp; Watch Collection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HZiBtXwyHM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HZiBtXwyHM</a><br />Waterblock Brawl: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOocQ9de1EM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOocQ9de1EM</a><br />Random Game 100: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng3yQaUTue8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng3yQaUTue8</a><br /><br />A special thanks to my Patrons who help support my content:<br />-Abdulla Mahboub<br />-Alex<br />-Christopher Conte<br />-Justatreeandall<br />-Milesluigi<br />-Phillip Shinn<br />-Swimming<br />-Tealgamemaster<br />-TheGreenLightningMRT<br />-Wayoshi<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AndrewHigsby">https://www.patreon.com/AndrewHigsby</a><br /><br />Check out my website where you can find links to my social media pages, Japanese to English translations I have worked on, and much more!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.higsby.net">https://www.higsby.net</a>{% endraw %}
