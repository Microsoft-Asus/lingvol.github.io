{% raw %}LDL cholesterol level: the difference between LDL and LDL cholesterol level; Is LDL-cholesterol truly 'bad' cholesterol? Is HDL-cholesterol protective? An in depth look at LDL cholesterol level and its physiological significance.<br /><br />Get the 7 day Cholesterol-lowering program here: thecholesterolchallenge.com (use code 50%OFF for half price)<br /><br />LDL cholesterol level under 100mg/dL. LDL vs LDL-cholesterol, cholesterol is NOT the problem, HDL is NOT good cholesterol and LDL is not ‘bad’. lipoproteins carry fat. lipoproteins: low density lipoprotein or LDL vs high-density lipoprotein or HDL. lab results: LDL-cholesterol level, not LDL. lipoproteins (LDL) carry  cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol is cholesterol carried in LDL lipoproteins. LDL lipoproteins = cars. LDL-cholesterol = passengers<br /><br />HDL-cholesterol = cholesterol traveling in HDL lipoproteins. add all cholesterol = Total cholesterol (lab results)<br /><br />Triglycerides in lipoproteins. LDL vs LDL-cholesterol level. good cholesterol and bad cholesterol? is LDL-cholesterol ‘bad’? animals with high LDL-cholesterol level, people with high LDL-cholesterol level = heart disease. people with low LDL-cholesterol level are health freaks?<br /><br />RCTs on LDL-cholesterol level: group with LDL-cholesterol level lowered has less heart disease. high LDL-cholesterol level is a problem. strong case that high LDL-cholesterol level is an issue<br /><br />we have different levels of LDL-cholesterol. low ldl-cholesterol level from birth = less heart disease. ldl-cholesterol level not 100% in genes<br /><br />high LDL-cholesterol level spells trouble. &quot;no longer an ‘LDL-Cholesterol hypothesis’. increased LDL-Cholesterol level causal; lowering LDL particles reduces events&quot;. “cholesterol-containing lipoproteins, particularly LDL cause CHD”<br /><br />does high LDL-cholesterol level cause heart disease? main problem are lipoproteins, not LDL-cholesterol. “number of lipoprotein particles rather than cholesterol or triglycerides”<br />Heart disease caused by lipoproteins stuck in artery wall. lab results: LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides. apoB (carried by LDL) tells us number of lipoproteins<br /><br />LDL-P (particles) = count of LDL lipoproteins. LDL lipoproteins = cause of heart disease. lab results: cholesterol... Is LDL-cholesterol level useless? for most people, more lipoproteins = more cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol level = ok estimation <br /><br />non-HDL cholesterol (Total cholesterol - HDL-cholesterol) = cholesterol not carried by HDL lipoproteins. if LDL-cholesterol level is good, chances are LDL particles are ok. lipoproteins carry cholesterol. too many lipoproteins cause heart disease, esp. LDL. LDL-Cholesterol gives idea of LDL lipoproteins<br />is HDL good? high HDL-cholesterol = less heart disease. hence good cholesterol. BUT raising HDL-cholesterol or genetically high HDL-cholesterol isn't better<br />“simplistic hypothesis for HDL-cholesterol: increasing levels reduces CV events&quot;. HDL not useless. HDL lipoproteins pull cholesterol from plaque. raising HDL-Cholesterol? people ask &quot;how do I get my HDL higher&quot; (they mean hdl-cholesterol, on lab results)<br />very high HDL-cholesterol level associated with higher risk? high LDL-Cholesterol + HDL-Cholesterol? is HDL-Cholesterol “bad”? good vs bad cholesterol doesn’t match evidence. LDL isn’t “bad”. We all have LDL and LDL-cholesterol.
