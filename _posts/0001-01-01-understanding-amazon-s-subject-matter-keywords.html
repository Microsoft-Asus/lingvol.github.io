Quick video demonstrating exactly how Subject Matter keywords work, where to place them, character limits and what is and is not indexed.<br /><br />An optimization question we still get pretty regularly is &quot;what should I put in the 'Subject Matter' keywords section?&quot;<br /><br />And honestly, up until recently, I wasn't 100% sure how to answer that question. So, I finally conducted an experiment. In this video you can see exactly how many characters you can put in subject matter keywords, what indexes, what doesn't, whether it stitches complete phrases together, whether repetition is necessary, and all the good details you always wanted to know.
