Email questions@deanbokhari.com<br /><br />This episode is inspired by an old Jim Rohn speech I used to listen to whenever I felt like I might be making excuses for not bringing my best on a daily basis; whenever I was faking it, and perhaps not being the best &quot;me&quot; that I possibly can be (at work, at home, at the gym, anywhere). I hope you enjoy listening to this episode. But more importantly, I hope you *do* something with it.<br /><br />Transcript<br />*This transcript may contain grammatical errors, because it was transcribed directly from my recording... so please be gentle on me if it's not perfect :-)<br /><br />How easy is it to get up in the morning when you know you're not doing all that it takes?<br /><br />Not very easy at all… You can just lay there awake thinking — oh &quot;what’s a few more minutes in bed, it won’t matter much anyway&quot;<br />WRONG — it does matter. It will matter. NOW, how easy is it to get up in the morning when you're pouring it on, doing the best you can, anxious to get going to make progress toward your dreams. it's a whole different story. when you're resting to renew your reserves it's much different than resting to avoid your day when your psyched up and excited for your life, when you're excited for what you plan to accomplish for the day, it's amazing you'll wake up before the alarm clock even tries to startle you awake <br />your successes fuel your ambition<br />your successes give you extra energy<br />your successes pave the way for more success<br />it's the snowball effect with one success you're excited to meet another and another and another… and pretty soon<br />the disciplines that were so difficult in the beginning,<br />the disciplines that got you going are now part of your philosophy.<br />How do you know when you're successful?<br />Do you have to be a millionaire? NO, all we ask of you is that you earn all that you possibly can, if you earn 10,000 a year and that's the best you can do that's enough...<br />God and everything else will see to it that you're OK<br />the key is to just do the best you can<br />if it's ten thousand a year — wonderful. if it’s a hundred thousand a year — wonderful. if it's a million a year — wonderful. it doesn't matter if it’s $10,000 a year or a million a year it doesn't matter — as long as you've done the best you possibly can...EARN the most you possibly can, BE the most you possibly can, and here's why: the essence of life is GROWTH, the essence of life is growth--to do the best you can! … and here's what's interesting — humans are the only life form that will do LESS than they possibly can, humans are the only life form that will settle for less, every other life for me except human beings drive to its maximum capacity... how tall a tree grow? as tall as it possibly can! you never heard a tree growing as half as high is it could, no, trees don't grow half, trees send their roots down as deep as possible, stretch their limbs up as high as possible, produce every leaf possible, and every fruit possible,<br />as a matter a fact... you never heard of the human physically growing half... we keep growing until we’re done...<br />now that's a part of life we can't control,<br />it's genetically coded and that's probably why we keep growing 'til we’re done, because we can't control that part,<br />it's the rest of the growing that we control,<br />the growing of our minds--the expansion of our minds that<br />we CAN control, and that's what tends to get away from us.<br />All life forms inherently strive to their MAX EXCEPT for human beings...<br /><br />Now why wouldn't human beings strive to their maximum possibility?<br />Here's why: because we've been given the dignity of *choice*.<br /><br />Choice makes us different than alligators and trees and birds.<br /><br />The dignity of choice makes us different than all other life forms...<br /><br />.. and here's the choice ——  to become PART of what we could be; enough to get by...<br /><br />OR to become ALL that we can BE...<br /><br />my best advice for you is to CHOOSE the ALL.... continue reading/listening at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://meaningfulhq.com/be-all-that-you-possibly-can.html">http://meaningfulhq.com/be-all-that-you-possibly-can.html</a> <br /><br />Want more motivation + inspiration? <br /><br />iTunes Podcast:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dean-bokharis-meaningful-show/id904829767?mt=2">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dean-bokharis-meaningful-show/id904829767?mt=2</a><br />Visit Dean's blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.deanbokhari.com">http://www.deanbokhari.com</a> for more science-backed articles, videos, and book summaries on: Personal Growth, Business, Scientific Self-Help, Lifehacks, Productivity, Motivation, and Meaningful Work.
