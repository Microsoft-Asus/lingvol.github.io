Ever since I went to Challenge 2012, I can say that my relationship with God has totally changed. And for the better! :) Kristian Stanfill and his band were SO amazing. I really loved them, so I thought I'd post one of my favourite songs of theirs!! Hope you all enjoy.<br /><br />~<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />I do not own this song, or the copyrights to it. All credit goes to Kristian Stanfill, his band, and God. :P This song is taken from Kristian's latest album, Mountains Move, which I also do not own.
