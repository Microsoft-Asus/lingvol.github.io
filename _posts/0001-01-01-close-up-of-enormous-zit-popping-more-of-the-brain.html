I had a somewhat large lump on the back of my neck for more than a decade. It wasn't really noticeable and it didn't hurt.<br /><br />That is, until it did start hurting, turning red and angry, and growing multiple whiteheads. It started to hurt even to tilt my head back because of all the pressure. The reason this became a story and video instead of a trip to the doctor is that, at the time, my wife and I were working in rural Laos and didn't have ready access to medical care, not least because of the language barrier.<br /><br />So, we purchased from a convenience store some gauze, isopropyl alcohol, and a purpose-built zit remover with a lancet on one end and a ring on the other.<br /><br />My wife started &quot;popping&quot; what we were joking must have been the biggest zit in the world. Pus started coming out from several pores with each squeeze. But it hurt, so I started to squeeze it myself so I could control the pressure. With my wife's hands free, she decided to film what she was seeing so she could show me what she was incredulously describing as &quot;unbelievable.&quot;<br /><br />The popping actually took place over several days. Every morning and evening, we would get our first-aid kit and camera and work on the next &quot;installment.&quot; This particular video was after the most productive popping episode, during which I felt a significant release of pressure, and then, no more pain!<br /><br />Now all that remains of the zit is a small scar on the back of my neck, and of course the video. <br /><br />Click our channel to see more clips!<br /><br />To use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@storyful.com
