After strong words from #CathieWood earlier this year, #ARKInvest finally completely sold out of #Illumina (#ILMN) stock. Just 4 months ago, it was #ARK Invest's 7th biggest position overall, being the 8th biggest holding in #ARKK and the 4th biggest holding in #ARKG. This makes for a great case study of what it looks like when ARK Invest *actually* loses conviction in a major holding and decides to sell out!<br /><br />In this video, I show how Cathie Wood and ARK Invest's conviction on Illumina has changed between August and December 2020. Then, I walk through exactly how ARK Invest sold out of the position, which looks very different than the sell-offs that typically get a lot of attention. After that, I give some advice on what YOU can do with all of this information and how you should use it going forward.<br /><br />In the Know with Cathie Wood, where she discusses Illumina's stagnating sequencing costs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9uzeN2NslAk?t=957">https://youtu.be/9uzeN2NslAk?t=957</a><br /><br />Illumina is the Bedrock of the Genomic Revolution, Catherine Wood, ARK Invest's CEO, and CIO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/market-commentary/illumina/">https://ark-invest.com/articles/market-commentary/illumina/</a><br /><br />ARK Invest's Genomic Innovations white paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-invest.com/white-papers/genomics-innovation-white-paper/">https://ark-invest.com/white-papers/genomics-innovation-white-paper/</a><br /><br />The ARK Invest funds discussed in this video are:<br />ARK Invest Innovation ETF (ARKK) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-funds.com/arkk">https://ark-funds.com/arkk</a><br />ARK Invest Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-funds.com/arkg">https://ark-funds.com/arkg</a><br /><br />My video on ARKG, ARK Invest's Genomic Revolution fund: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dIHDOA8rRA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dIHDOA8rRA</a><br /><br />ARK Invest's other actively managed ETFs: <br />ARK Invest Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf">https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf</a><br />ARK Invest Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-funds.com/arkw">https://ark-funds.com/arkw</a><br />ARK Invest Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (ARKQ) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ark-funds.com/arkq">https://ark-funds.com/arkq</a><br /><br />My video on ARKQ, ARK Invest's Autonomous Revolution fund: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqMaH8U9c7g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqMaH8U9c7g</a><br /><br />Quick but great coverage of Illumina (ILMN) by an excellent YouTuber, #ChickenGeniusSingapore - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OnreqP55xLpA6W5nzxb5Q/search?query=illumina">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OnreqP55xLpA6W5nzxb5Q/search?query=illumina</a><br /><br />Timestamps for this video<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:55 Illumina's Fall From Grace<br />05:04 Sizing the ARK ILMN Breakup<br />08:56 Watch as Shares Go to ZERO<br />14:27 Pulling Sell Signals Out of Noise<br />17:43 Case Study Final Thoughts<br /><br />I am not a financial advisor or affiliated with ARK Invest in any way.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!
