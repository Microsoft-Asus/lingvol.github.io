{% raw %}An illiberal democracy, also called a partial democracy, low intensity democracy, empty democracy, or hybrid regime, is a governing system in which, although elections take place, citizens are cut off from knowledge about the activities of those who exercise real power because of the lack of civil liberties. It is not an &quot;open society&quot;. There are many countries &quot;that are categorized as neither 'free' nor 'not free', but as 'probably free', falling somewhere between democratic and nondemocratic regimes&quot;. This may be because a constitution limiting government powers exists, but its liberties are ignored, or because an adequate legal constitutional framework of liberties does not exist.<br /><br /><br />This video is targeted to blind users.<br /><br />Attribution:<br />Article text available under CC-BY-SA<br />Creative Commons image source in video{% endraw %}
