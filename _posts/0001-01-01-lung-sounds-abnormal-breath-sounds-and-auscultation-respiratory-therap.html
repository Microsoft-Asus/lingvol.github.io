When an abnormality is heard in a patient's breath sounds, this indicates that other health issues may be present, such as:<br /><br />▪ Asthma<br />▪ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br />▪ Foreign body obstruction<br />▪ Accumulation of fluid<br />▪ Heart failure<br />▪ Infection<br />▪ Inflammation of the airways<br />▪ Pneumonia<br /><br />By listening to the quality, duration, and intensity of breath sounds, healthcare professionals can learn a lot more about a patient's condition in order to provide the most appropriate forms of treatment. <br /><br />➡️ What is Auscultation?<br />Auscultation is a simple, non-invasive procedure that involves the use of a stethoscope to listen to the sounds produced by the body. For the sake of this video, of course, we’re focusing specifically on the lungs. A stethoscope amplifies the sounds within the lungs so that we can hear and have an idea of what’s going on with the patient's condition. When performing lung auscultation, the bell or diaphragm of the stethoscope is placed on the patient’s chest and/or back. Both sides can be compared with one another and the sounds of each lung should be compared as well.<br /><br />➡️ Types of Breath Sounds:<br /><br />1. Vesicular Breath Sounds<br />Vesicular is just another name for normal breath sounds. They are low-pitch sounds that you would expect to hear as air flows through an open airway. The sounds are usually soft and can be heard throughout the inspiratory and expiratory phase.<br /><br />2. Adventitious Breath Sounds<br />Adventitious breath sounds are the abnormal sounds that occur over the lungs and airways during auscultation. Adventitious breath sounds are commonly associated with a wide array of heart and lung conditions. The type, duration, location, and intensity of each adventitious breath sounds can help medical professionals diagnose and treat medical conditions. <br /><br />➡️ Lung Sounds that You Should Be Familiar With:<br />1. Crackles (Rales)<br />2. Wheezes<br />3. Rhonchi<br />4. Stridor<br />5. Diminished Breath Sounds<br />6. Pleural friction rub<br /><br />➡️ Causes of Abnormal Breath Sounds:<br />▪ Crackles – lung sounds that are caused by air moving through secretions of the small or middle airways.<br />▪ Wheezes – lung sounds that are caused by air moving through a narrowed or constricted airway.<br />▪ Rhonchi – a lung sound that is caused by air moving through secretions in the larger airways.<br />▪ Stridor – a lung sound that occurs when an upper airway obstruction is present. <br />▪ Diminished – heard when there is decreased air movement in the lungs. <br />▪ Pleural friction rub – a lung sound that is heard when inflamed pleura rub together due to decreased levels of fluid in the pleural space<br /><br />➡️ What are Bronchial Breath Sounds?<br />They are hollow lung sounds that can be heard in both normal and abnormal conditions. They are often a sign of pneumonia.<br /><br />—————<br /><br />📗 BEST STUDY GUIDES FOR YOU<br />▪ TMC Study Guide 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2X5ndXd">http://bit.ly/2X5ndXd</a><br />▪ CSE Study Guide 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Mo0sd4">http://bit.ly/2Mo0sd4</a><br />▪ TMC Test Bank 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu">http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu</a><br />▪ Daily TMC Practice Questions 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C">http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C</a><br />▪ Hacking the TMC Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XBc8do">http://bit.ly/2XBc8do</a><br />▪ TMC/CSE Bundle Package (save big) 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2L6vdRx">http://bit.ly/2L6vdRx</a><br /><br />🥼BEST RESPIRATORY MERCH<br />▪ T-Shirts 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZuLuTZ">http://bit.ly/2ZuLuTZ</a><br />▪ Hoodies 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WOioSU">http://bit.ly/2WOioSU</a><br />▪ Accessories 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XV8uvh">http://bit.ly/2XV8uvh</a><br />▪ Jewelry 👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Knnwqn">http://bit.ly/2Knnwqn</a><br /><br />—————<br /><br />💙MORE FROM RTZ<br />▪ Free TMC Practice Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XlwASL">http://bit.ly/2XlwASL</a><br />▪ Free RRT Cheat Sheet 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB">http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB</a><br />▪ Our World-Famous Test Bank 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Kp73ln">http://bit.ly/2Kp73ln</a><br />▪ Our Story 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Xgk5YH">http://bit.ly/2Xgk5YH</a><br />▪ Resources for RT's 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo">http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo</a><br />▪ Testimonials 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl">http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl</a><br /><br />🌐FOLLOW US<br />▪ Instagram 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV">http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV</a><br />▪ Twitter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1">http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1</a><br />▪ Facebook 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MSEejt">http://bit.ly/2MSEejt</a><br />▪ Pinterest 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw">http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw</a><br /><br />—————<br /><br />🎸MUSIC<br />Disfigure - Blank [NCS Release]<br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/p7ZsBPK656s">https://youtu.be/p7ZsBPK656s</a><br />Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ncs.io/blank">http://ncs.io/blank</a><br /><br />💡DISCLAIMER<br />Medicine and Respiratory Therapy are continuously changing practices.
