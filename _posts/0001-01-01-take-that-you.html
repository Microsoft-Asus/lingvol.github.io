Lyrics are below:<br /><br /><br /><br />It's not a spark that gives me light<br /><br />It's not the days<br /><br />I'm up all night<br /><br />It isn't a story I have read<br /><br />Or a picture in my head<br /><br /><br /><br />It's not the world that pulls me through<br /><br />It wasn't a question before I knew<br /><br />Was just an answer here by my side<br /><br />I found it out just in time<br /><br /><br /><br />It's you<br /><br />Yeah, it's you<br /><br /><br /><br />Give me your hurt, if you're feeling pain<br /><br />Tell me your secrets, I'll keep them safe<br /><br />Give me your love mixed up with sin<br /><br />In every part of everything<br /><br /><br /><br />It's you<br /><br />Yeah, it's you<br /><br /><br /><br />From now 'till the end<br /><br />From now 'till the end<br /><br />From now 'till the end, my friend<br /><br />It's a moment of glory<br /><br />My one and only<br /><br /><br /><br />It's you<br /><br />Oh yeah, it's you<br /><br />It's you (x4)<br /><br />It's you, just you<br /><br />It's you
