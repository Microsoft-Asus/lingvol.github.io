For the first time the Nobel Week Dialogue will be open to all as we bring Nobel Laureates and experts together online to discuss the challenge of learning.<br /><br />Be inspired and put your own questions to our speakers, who include world-renowned pianist Igor Levit, African Development Bank Group president Akinwumi Adesina and eight Nobel Laureates, including 2020 Chemistry Laureate Emmanuelle Charpentier, awarded the Nobel Prize for her work on CRISPR.<br /><br />Join us online as we place the spotlight on learning, and explore how education can help create a better future: the future we want.<br /><br />From the role of technology to the question of what we ought to know in order to meet the global challenges ahead, the themes discussed at the dialogue underpin our future. What works, what doesnâ€™t, and what are the benefits and pitfalls of our new, digital world and learning at a distance? With billions lacking the resources or time to access such education, will technology truly deliver equality of opportunity?<br /><br />The Nobel Week Dialogue will, as always, be a true meeting of science and society, bringing together an intergenerational group of participants from a range of geographies and backgrounds to discuss how best to shape the future of learning.
