{% raw %}With severe covid restrictions going on for most of the world, I've been very surprised how relaxed many of the Balkan countries have been and are readily welcoming tourism. I'm not saying that everyone SHOULD be traveling right now, but if you wondering what your options would include, the Balkans are most likely one of your best options (at least in December 2020). I've definitely adapted how I travel this year to stay as safe as possible, but I do believe that it is possible to travel AND stay safe for people who have low risk factors and aren't coming into close contact with many other people. Many of you guys had asked what it's like to go inbetween borders at this weird time, so I thought I'd film my land border crossing from North Macedonia to Albania. Hope you guys enjoy! xx<br /><br />Support my journey on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/alinamcleod">https://www.patreon.com/alinamcleod</a><br />Paypal Account: alina_397@hotmail.com<br /><br />Get $45 FREE STAY CREDIT AND A $17 EXPERIENCE CREDIT when you sign up for AirBnB with my link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airbnb.ca/c/alinam556">https://www.airbnb.ca/c/alinam556</a><br /><br />The Music I Use In My Videos - Epidemic Sound<br />Get a 30 Day FREE TRIAL by using my referral link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/j6z374/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/j6z374/</a><br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />Мой русскоязычный канал / My Russian Speaking Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUO4pFMywMoe3TBMcbJq2IA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUO4pFMywMoe3TBMcbJq2IA</a><br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />- Equipment I Use To Film Videos -<br /><br />My extensive list of all equipment on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/shop/alinamcleod">https://www.amazon.ca/shop/alinamcleod</a><br /><br />Main Camera: DJI Osmo Pocket - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/37MZgsx">https://amzn.to/37MZgsx</a><br /><br />Action Camera: Sony FDRX-3000 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2AEDuci">https://amzn.to/2AEDuci</a><br /><br />Drone: DJI Spark (they don't make it as much now, but the comparable choice is Mavic Mini) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3kDk35l">https://amzn.to/3kDk35l</a><br /><br />Microphone: Rode Micro - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3muSHz8">https://amzn.to/3muSHz8</a><br /><br />*** FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA ***<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alinamcleod/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/alinamcleod/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/alinamcleodofficial/?view_public_for=189580024403094">https://www.facebook.com/alinamcleodofficial/?view_public_for=189580024403094</a><br /><br />WEBSITE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alinamcleod.com/">http://www.alinamcleod.com/</a><br /><br /><br />*** I USE AFFILIATE LINKS ***<br />Affiliate links do not cost you as the consumer any more than you would normally pay, but it does offer a kickback to the person who initiated the sale.
