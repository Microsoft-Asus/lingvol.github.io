In view of corona virus infection, the Maharashtra government has issued guidelines for people coming from outside. Those who are traveling from Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat towards Maharashtra will have to bring negative report of RTPR test. The report must be nearby 72 hours before arrival at any airport in Maharashtra. Those who do not have a report will have to test at their own expense at the airport. After the process is complete, passengers can leave the airport.<br />#MaharashtraGovernment #LockdownGuidlines #ABPNewsLive<br /><br />To Subscribe to our YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/abpnewstv">https://www.youtube.com/user/abpnewstv</a> <br /> <br />Download ABP App for Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/abp-live-abp-news-abp-ananda/id811114904?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/abp-live-abp-news-abp-ananda/id811114904?mt=8</a> <br />Download ABP App for Android: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.winit.starnews.hin&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.winit.starnews.hin&amp;hl=en</a><br /> <br />About Channel:<br />ABP News is a news hub which provides you with comprehensive up-to-date news coverage from all over India and World.
