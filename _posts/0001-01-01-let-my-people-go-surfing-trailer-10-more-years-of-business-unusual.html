The revised and updated on the 10th anniversary of its original publication, Let My People Go Surfing is the story of an iconoclastic entrepreneur who brought doing good to the heart of his business. But even more so, itâ€™s about challenging conventional wisdom, leading a simpler and more examined life, and making a living without losing your soul.<br /> <br />In full color with over 70 new photos. Printed on 100% post-consumer-recycled paper. Foreword by Naomi Klein.
