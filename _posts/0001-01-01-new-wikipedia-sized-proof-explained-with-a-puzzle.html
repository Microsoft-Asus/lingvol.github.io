A new mathematical proof was in the news this week, which partially solves the Erdos Discrepancy Problem. The proof was described as &quot;bigger than Wikipedia&quot;. I attempt to explain the problem using a puzzle which you can try at home.<br /><br />The puzzle was my idea to explain it to you - that's not really how the problem is stated.<br /><br />New Scientist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25068-wikipediasize-maths-proof-too-big-for-humans-to-check.html#.UwdX6_l_uSp">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25068-wikipediasize-maths-proof-too-big-for-humans-to-check.html#.UwdX6_l_uSp</a><br />The Independent: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/computer-cracks-erds-puzzle--but-no-human-brain-can-check-the-answer-9137097.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/computer-cracks-erds-puzzle--but-no-human-brain-can-check-the-answer-9137097.html</a><br /><br />Tim Gowers Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/recent-news-concerning-the-erdos-discrepancy-problem/">http://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/recent-news-concerning-the-erdos-discrepancy-problem/</a><br />PolyMath Project: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=The_Erd%C5%91s_discrepancy_problem">http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=The_Erd%C5%91s_discrepancy_problem</a><br /><br />The paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~konev/SAT14/sat14.pdf">http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~konev/SAT14/sat14.pdf</a><br />Boris Konev's webpage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~konev/SAT14/">http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~konev/SAT14/</a><br /><br />One page proof that a sequence of twelve has discrepency of 2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/erdoschu.pdf">http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/erdoschu.pdf</a>
