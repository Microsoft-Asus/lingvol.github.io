Taken from the very first Metropole Session in Muziekcentrum van de Omroep, Hilversum! With mediapartner Radio 2 we presented an intimate concert with the wonderful Kovacs. The audience sat amongst the orchestra for a special experience.<br /><br />Composition by Sharon Kovacs, arranged by Tom Trapp
