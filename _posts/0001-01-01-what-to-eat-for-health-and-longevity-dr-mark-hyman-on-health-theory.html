Mark Hyman is one of the foremost practitioners of functional medicine, one of its earliest advocates, and is certainly one of its best spokesmen. On this episode of Health Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Mark Hyman explains the rationale behind functional medicine and describes its most important features. He also gives detailed advice on improving the diet, talks about what it means to say that food is information, and discusses the connection between the body, mind, gut and brain. <br /><br />Get a copy of Mark's new book &quot;Food Fix&quot; here:Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38mWyY8">https://amzn.to/38mWyY8</a><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />What does it mean to say the body is an ecosystem?
