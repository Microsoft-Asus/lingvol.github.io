Rebirth in the Western Pure Land requires faith, vows, and practice. Faith is religious conviction, to be convinced of the existence of the Western Pure Land introduced by Shakyamuni Buddha, and to truly believe in the existence of Amitabha Buddha, as well as the power of Amitabha's vow. Vows means the aspiration to be reborn in the Pure Land. Practice means spiritual cultivation. <br /><br />More online courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DDMTV05">https://www.youtube.com/user/DDMTV05</a>
