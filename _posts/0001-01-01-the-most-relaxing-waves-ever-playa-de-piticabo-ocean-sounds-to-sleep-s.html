A special treat today with some of the most relaxing wave sounds we have ever recorded from Playa de Piticabo in Dominican republic. Pebble beach sounds are unique in its kind, perfect for sleeping or studying, and for just about anything you may be doing. Keep this video playing to create a calming atmosphere wherever you are. Highly recommended at any office as a relaxing background or at home, in class at school, in any waiting room setting, at hospitals and dental clinics. Relax your mind and body every day and night.
