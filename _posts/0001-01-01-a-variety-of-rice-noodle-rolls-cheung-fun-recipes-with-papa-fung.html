The humble rice noodle roll (aka steamed rice roll) pronounced &quot;cheung fun&quot; is like a thin steamed springy crepe that is rolled into the shape of a log. There are many varieties and filling options that go into the rice noodle roll, but the original one is plain served with roasted sesame, sesame sauce, sweet soy sauce and sweet sauce.<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:22 Part 1: Ingredients Prep<br />0:25 Part 1.1: Ingredients Prep - Beef Rice Noodle Roll<br />1:15 Part 1.2: Ingredients Prep - Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll<br />2:49 Part 1.3: Ingredients Prep - Dried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Noodle Roll<br />3:27 Part 2: Sauces<br />3:31 Part 2.1: Sauces -Sweet Soy Sauce<br />4:07 Part 2.2: Sauces - Sweet Sauce<br />4:51 Part 3: Rice Noodle Roll Batter<br />5:11 Part 4: Assembly<br />5:14 Part 4.1.1: Assembly - Plain Rice Roll<br />5:55 Part 4.1.2: Finale - Plain Rice Roll<br />6:17 Part 4.2.1: Assembly - Beef Rice Roll<br />6:43 Part 4.2.2: Finale - Beef Rice Roll<br />6:55 Part 4.3.1: Assembly - Shrimp Rice Roll<br />7:21 Part 4.3.2: Finale - Shrimp Rice Roll<br />7:31 Part 4.4.1: Assembly - Dried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Roll<br />7:34 Part 4.4.2.1: Assembly - Steamed Dried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Roll<br />8:07 Part 4.4.2.2: Finale - Steamed Dried Shrimp and Scallion RiceRoll<br />8:20 Part 4.4.3.1: Assembly - Pan Fried Dried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Roll<br />8:42 Part 4.4.3.2: Finale - Pan Fried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Roll<br />8:50 Part 4.5.1: Assembly - Fried Dough Fritter Rice Roll<br />9:21 Part 4.5.2: Finale - Fried Dough Fritter Rice Roll<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A VARIETY OF RICE NOODLE ROLL RECIPES<br />This recipe makes 18 rice noodles (filling is your preference). <br /><br />[ INGREDIENTS ]<br />Plain Rice Roll:<br />300g Rice Flour<br />80g Potato Starch<br />80g Wheat Starch<br />1200ml Water<br />2tbsp Oil<br /><br />Filling: Beef Rice Roll<br />(This makes 4)<br />4oz Beef<br />Some Sugar<br />Some Soy Sauce<br />Some White pepper<br />Some Potato Starch<br />Some Oil<br />Some Sesame Oil<br /><br />Filling: Shrimp Rice Roll<br />(This makes 5)<br />4oz Shrimp<br />A Sprinkle Salt<br />Some Potato Starch<br />Some Sugar<br />Some White Pepper<br />Some Oil<br />Some Sesame Oil <br /><br />Filling: Dried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Roll<br />(This makes 4 )<br />3 Stalks Green Onion<br />2oz Dried Shrimp<br /><br />Filling: Fried Dough Rice Roll<br />(This makes 2)<br />1 Stick of Fried Dough<br /><br />Sweet Soy Sauce<br />100ml Soy Sauce<br />20ml Dark Soy Sauce<br />100g Sugar<br />250ml Water<br /><br />.<br />.<br />[ DIRECTIONS ]<br />1. Filling Prep (Beef): Thinly slice beef into strips. Marinade it with sugar, soy sauce and mix. Add in white pepper, oil, potato starch and sesame oil, mix and set aside in the fridge.<br />2. Filling Prep (Shrimp): Mix salt and potato starch with the shrimp, let it sit for 10 minutes. Rinse it off until clean, and dry off all the shrimp. Optional: you can split shrimp in half if it’s big. Marinate it in salt, sugar and white pepper, mix, add potato startch, oil and sesame oil, mix some more and set aside. <br />3. Filling (Dried shrimp &amp; Scallion): Soak dried shrimp in water until soft. Drain and dry the shrimp and then dice into smaller pieces. Dice green onions into smaller pieces. Set aside. <br />4. Sweet Soy Sauce: Boil water and melt sugar, then add soy sauce, dark soy and cook until boiling and set aside. Note: If you can’t finish all the soy sauce, put it in the fridge to save it for later or it will go bad.<br />5. Sweet Sauce: Make a corn starch slurry, set aside. Use a portion of sweet soy sauce made earlier, heat it up until boiling, add water (1/3 amount of the sweet soy sauce) and sugar, to taste. Slowly add in corn starch slurry until it starts to thicken, then remove from heat, set aside to cool. Note: if sauce is too thick, you can add a bit of boiling water to thin it out.<br />6. Rice Noodle Batter: Combine rice flour, potato starch and wheat start together. Add oil and 1/3 of the water and mix first. Make sure the dry ingredients completely absorb the oil before adding the rest of the water in. Once all the water has been added, mix until combined, set aside. <br />7. Assembly: Boil water, place baking pan on top of steaming rack to heat it up. Brush oil on the pan, stir the batter and then pour a thin layer (enough to cover the pan) of it on the pan. Steam for a minute (if there are no bubbles steam it for another minute) and roll it up and serve. To make the other types of rice noodles with filling, just add the filling on top of the batter (EXCEPT the fried dough stick) and steam for 1 minute. For fried dough stick, place the fried dough ontop of the steamed rice noodle, and roll the noodle over the dough stick and serve.<br />8. Note: For the Dried Shrimp and Scallion Rice Noodle Rolls, you can serve it steamed, or you can pan fry it. If you pan fry, use rice noodles left overnight for better results. <br />9. Note: For plain rice noodle, top it off with roasted sesame, Sweet Soy Sauce, sesame sauce and a dash of sweet sauce.<br /><br />——————————————————————————————<br />Music/Sound Credits: <br />Mixtape - Vintage Hip Hop Beat (Prod.
