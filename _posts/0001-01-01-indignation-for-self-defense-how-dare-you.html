The CrossFit Journal -- (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://journal.crossfit.com)">http://journal.crossfit.com)</a><br /><br />If a bad guy sticks a gun in your face, makes the mistake of not killing you and then further makes the mistake of talking, it's your lucky day.<br /><br />&quot;If a guy stuck a gun in your face, would he expect you to put your hands up in fear? Yeah,&quot; explains Tony Blauer, who owns Blauer Tactical Systems and leads the CrossFit Defense courses.<br /><br />Luckily, that nonviolent posture also is ideal for grabbing the gun. At that point, all you need to remember is the shape of a question mark or a light bulb to keep the gun from being pointed at your face—and, of course, also bite, scratch and become indignant.<br /><br />&quot;You gotta start going crazy,&quot; Blauer says. &quot;The movements that we're doing here are things you all can do.&quot;<br /><br />He adds: &quot;Indignation is my favorite word in our courses. ... Indignation is that moment where I go, 'How dare you?'&quot;<br /><br />Video by Jay Vera.<br /><br />The CrossFit Games® - The Sport of Fitness™<br />The Fittest On Earth™
