I think I owe a lot of you an explanation as to why I had to abandon my channel and quit YouTube for a while. It wasn’t something I wanted to do, but there are more important things to take care of. In short, I had to get my life in order, and making videos had to be put on hold.<br /> So kick back, relax and let’s get caught up so we can get this ball rolling again! Thank you to everyone who has supported this channel over the last year!
