Bring Change to Mind (BC2M) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging dialogue about mental health, and to raising awareness, understanding, and empathy.<br /><br />Actress &amp; activist Glenn Close co-founded Bring Change to Mind in 2010 after her sister, Jessie Close, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and her nephew, Calen Pick, with schizoaffective disorder.<br /><br />Every individual who speaks out inspires another. And another. That’s how we’ll end the stigma around mental illness. That’s how we’ll Bring Change to Mind.
