{% raw %}Lets go over (in my opinion) the worst bank accounts out there and the specifics that make them so unappealing - enjoy!

Many elements have been exaggerated for comedic effect. Do your own research and come to your own conclusion. This is not financial advice - for entertainment purposes only! <br /><br />These are all banks that - in my opinion - have too many fees and pay very little in interest compared with other, online banks. Anytime I look for a bank to put my money, I pay close attention to any monthly maintenance fees, cost of sending or receiving wires, how to waive those fees, and the interest I’ll be paid from that account.<br /><br />Generally, online banks have much less overhead and - because of that - they can pass those savings on to you by paying significantly more in interest. Many of those banks also don’t have as many fees as traditional banks do. <br /><br />Number 5: Chase Bank<br />This is disappointing for me to mention, because the Chase Sapphire Reserve is one of my favorite Credit Cards, not to mention that Chase has several of the BEST credit cards currently on the market, all with REALLY good rewards.  Chase Bank ALSO holds 2 of my mortgages, and they had INSANELY good interest rate at the time I applied…plus, their Chase Private Client services and perks are phenomenal when you deposit more than $250,000 with them…however, I have to say it…I have to call them out for this, because to me… their actual bank account is just…BAD. <br /><br />Number 4: Bank of America<br />In their defense, hey’ve got a REALLY great credit card for people just starting out and building their credit, the Bank Of America Cash Rewards Card. They also have REALLY great mortgage rates…I refinanced one of my properties through them, and they were awesome. And their mobile app is REALLY easy to use, and the entire online interface is AWESOME. But, for me….the friendship ends there, and that’s where the line is drawn. <br /><br />Number 3: Wells Fargo<br />Wells Fargo has been one of the only Bank Account I have EVER gone out of my way to cancel. Typically, it’s easy for me to keep $1500 in an account just to keep it open and maintain that relationship with the bank in the event I ever use them for a mortgage…but, nope, this was just SO bad that I couldn’t stand to keep it open. <br /><br />Number 2: US Bank<br />Unfortunately, the number of fees - combined with how little they pay you in interest - makes this bank rather unappealing. <br /><br />Number 1: CitiBank<br />This is the ONLY OTHER bank that I have gone OUT OF MY WAY TO CANCEL because it was just SO BAD. This is another one that I don’t like to mention…because their Double Cash rewards credit card is AWESOME…but the bank itself, from my experience, is a different story. <br /><br />Some better options (Not paid to say this, not sponsored - just my opinion):<br />Ally Bank, no fees, no minimums - 1.7% interest<br />Marcus by Goldman Sachs - no fees, no minimums, 1.7% interest<br />CIT Bank, no fees, $1000 minimum, but pays 1.8%<br />PNC Bank - No fees, no minimums, 1.7% Interest <br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
