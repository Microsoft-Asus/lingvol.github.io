Tony Robbins is an author, motivational speaker and life coach. He explains that most people believe they can't do something because of a lack of resources. They don't accomplish their goal because they don't have enough money, enough time, enough ability, etc. The most successful people don't achieve their success because resources are handed to them, they achieve success because they are RESOURCEFUL. Resourcefulness is the ultimate resource. In order to be resourceful, you must master your emotions. <br /><br />If you are interested in making your own whiteboard animation, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.afterskool.net/">https://www.afterskool.net/</a> and contact us. <br /><br />Please help us keep this channel running by supporting us on Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool">https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool</a><br /><br />Lastly, hit the notifications bell to see future videos.
