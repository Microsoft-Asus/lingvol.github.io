{% raw %}Entering new markets internationally is a great way for businesses to grow their sales, expand their reach and spread risk - but it comes with multiple risks as well.<br /><br />Gallagher give an overview of the different options exporters have, covering different forms of risk and different policies which cover them. They will also update on the latest situation with the insurance market in regard to Brexit and COVID-19. <br /><br />Open to Export webinars are powered by the Institute of Export &amp; International Trade – the UK’s only professional body representing international trade, recognised by the World Trade Organisation and the International Chamber of Commerce as a 'Small Business Champion'.<br /><br />Catch up with all of our webinars at opentoexport.com/webinars{% endraw %}
