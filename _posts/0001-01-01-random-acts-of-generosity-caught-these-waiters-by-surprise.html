{% raw %}The following video was part of an initiative whereby we wanted to show members of our congregation how simple it is to show small acts of kindness and generosity and the impact it can have on people's lives. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />The purpose of filming was not to get &quot;youtube views&quot; but to show how a generous gift can make a difference to people and to encourage people to be generous.{% endraw %}
