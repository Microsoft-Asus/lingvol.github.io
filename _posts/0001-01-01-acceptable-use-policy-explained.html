An AUP outlines the rules of online behavior and penalties for violations of the policy. Having an AUP can help reduce wasted time on the internet, reduce bandwidth and equipment needs, and protect you from lawsuits that can arise from inappropriate use on the web. In many cases an AUP is a regulatory requirement. Every business should have one in place because every state has a breach notification regulation. <br /><br />On top of having an AUP in place, it’s also prudent to have a monitoring software on your office computers. These monitors can help block certain websites, monitor what sites employees are going to, and monitor the amount of time spent on the web. This content filtering will also help protect you from cyber security breaches and any liability associated with a breach.<br /><br />If someone complains that this is a violation of their privacy, rest assured that nothing could be further from the truth. It’s not only legal but good business. After all, they are using your company assets and if employees are focused on productive work and minimize personal use of the Internet, you’re likely to never need to address their Internet usage. Just be sure to include a clause about Internet monitoring in your IAUP and have your employees sign the agreement.<br /><br />We have put together a template that you can use and modify for your business. Make sure you have your legal team review this before putting it in place. Also, make sure you have ongoing training with your staff to review your policies and update your policies regularly. If you are a current client of DPC Technology and want to implement or update your acceptable use policy please reach out and we can schedule time to customize this on your next quarterly business review (QBR).  <br /><br />If you are not currently a client and you would like to discuss this or other IT needs please reach out to us at the address below and we can set aside some time to discuss your needs.
