The EU <br />aims to play a key role in keeping markets open worldwide and helping Europe to exit from the economic crisis. EU trade policy is working to: create a global system for fair and open trade, open up markets with key partner countries, make sure others play by the rules and ensure trade is a force for sustainable development
