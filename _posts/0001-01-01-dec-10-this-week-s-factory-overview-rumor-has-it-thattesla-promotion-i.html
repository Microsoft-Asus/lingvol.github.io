{% raw %}This week Tesla's Shanghai factory is ramping up for the upcoming new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, both expected to launch in the first quarter of next year, for which there are rumors that Tesla is conducting a promotional inventory clearance campaign in China for the arrival of the new Model 3 and Model Y. If true, this will help free up space for the new M3 and M Y and achieve its goal of selling 500,000 units this year.<br /><br />Video shooting time:Dec 10<br /><br />Please support this channel!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/wuwa700?locale....">https://www.paypal.me/wuwa700?locale....</a><br /><br />Please comment, subscribe and share!：<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxAm...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxAm...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBb5Xa89N7xHjsa-T-D5yGQ?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBb5Xa89N7xHjsa-T-D5yGQ?view_as=subscriber</a>  （This is Shanghai City Walk, a channel where you can keep up to date with the city streets of Shanghai)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bentv_sh">https://twitter.com/bentv_sh</a><br /><br />For the video of Berlin Giga, I recommend Tobias Lindh’s channel：<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TEL0000">https://www.youtube.com/user/TEL0000</a>{% endraw %}
