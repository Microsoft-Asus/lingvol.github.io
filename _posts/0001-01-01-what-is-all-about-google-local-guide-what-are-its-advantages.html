{% raw %}It’s about passion on adding places the their maps. It’s not actually mapping, it is contributing to the already existing maps by adding places, comments, information and pictures. It is about rating these places and answering questions about how they are and what they do. It is called crowd sourcing.<br /><br />You will do this because (supposedly) you enjoy this and you get benefits from the time you use and other people will benefit because they receive information about a place in advance so they can decide whether to go/use this place or not.<br /><br />How are you rewarded:<br /><br />The more you add and help the higher you will go as a level and the higher you go you get more benefits. I, for example, have got 100 GB free storage for one year in exchange for the data I have contributed. Benefits for contributors will change from year to year.<br /><br />How are normal users rewarded:<br /><br />A user will receive information and evaluations of a place in advance so he/she will be able to decide if and when to use or go to a place. A business owner will be able to understand whether his business is running properly or not based on the comments and information provided by the users.<br /><br />It is also an interesting marketing platform as normal pictures, photo spheres and street view images are available on the platform for people to see.{% endraw %}
