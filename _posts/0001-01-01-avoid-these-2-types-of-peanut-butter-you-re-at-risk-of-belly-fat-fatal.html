Train With The Most Effective Methods For Six Pack Abs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://go.sixpackabs.com/sciend26d">http://go.sixpackabs.com/sciend26d</a><br /><br />Check Out Thomas' Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.YouTube.com/TheTDeLauer">http://www.YouTube.com/TheTDeLauer</a><br /><br />What is up, SixPackAbs.com? Thomas here with another video on foods you have been eating that you think are healthy, but really, are doing the opposite for your fat loss and muscle building. <br /><br />I'm going to go over the 3 types of peanut butter that you run into at the grocery store - 2 of them you need to ABSOLUTELY avoid. Let's get to it:<br /><br />1:00 - &quot;The Basics&quot;<br /><br />These contain what's known as Hydrogenated Oils (usually hydrogenated SOYBEAN oils). You see, soy is extremely phytoestrogenic and causes low testosterone and high estrogen levels. This causes burning fat to become much more difficult. <br /><br />The hydrogenation process causes artificial hydrogen to be added to a fat molecule, resulting in a trans fat - a poison that doesn't exist naturally, with the exception of a little amount in cow's milk. <br /><br />The problem with trans fats is that compared to standard regular fat (cis) that takes 18 days to break down in half, trans fat takes around 51 days to breakdown in half... That's nearly 3 times as long! Trans fats not only end up clogging your arteries but slows down other enzymatic processes. <br /><br />3:24 - &quot;The Naturals&quot;<br /><br />Yes, they don't contain hydrogenated oils like the regular peanut butter, however, they still contain a bunch of sugar and palm oil.<br /><br />When palm oil is added to a refining process, it creates glycidyl fatty acid esters that are both genotoxic (DNA-altering) and carcinogenic (Cancer-causing).<br /><br />These &quot;natural&quot; peanut butter options still contain monoglycerides - fatty acid molecules bound to a glycerin - and diglycerides - two fatty acid molecules bound to a glycerin. This makes it dangerously close to being a triglyceride and trans fat, and we don't want that. <br /><br />5:13 - &quot;The Real PB's&quot;<br /><br />True peanut butter normally only contains peanuts and salt. A rule of thumb to life by when getting peanut butter is to simply look for those 2 ingredients and NOTHING else - you just don't need it.<br /><br />You are trying to get the benefits from the oils in the peanuts - the Omega 3 &amp; 6 - so don't muddy the waters with the extras that are clearly going to hold you back from burning fat and getting those six pack abs. <br /><br />Going organic is the way to go - they are free of organophosphates and carbamates, thus reducing the likelihood of petrochemical (causes birth defects and degenerative disease) exposure.<br /><br />5:54 - Alternatives To Peanut Butter<br /><br />Get some almond butter. Make sure to look for smooth almond butter when getting it.<br /><br />Like I said, it's not worth saving the extra couple bucks on the cheaper basic or &quot;natural&quot; peanut butter at the grocery store - less is more. Peanuts and salt is all that you should read on the label.<br /><br />As always, thanks for tuning in, guys.
