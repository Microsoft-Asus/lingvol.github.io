In this video, you'll discover how to commit to a goal and stick to it.<br /><br />So why do we all get distracted from the most important goals in our lives?<br /><br />According to the studies the biggest problem is a lack of commitment to the goal.<br /><br />And the main reason for not committing comes down to the way we initially set the goal.<br /><br />There was a study named Self-regulation of goals back in 2011 by Gabriele Oettingen, the author of the book Rethinking Positive Thinking, that examined how we can enhance our commitment to a goal.<br /><br />They had 136 people in 3 groups:<br />Group 1 - Indulge: imagine a positive vision of the problem solved.<br />Group 2 - Dwell: think about the negative aspects of the current situation.<br />Group 3 Contrast: first imagine a positive vision of the problem solved then think about the negative aspects of reality. With both in mind, participants were asked to carry out a ‘reality check’, comparing their fantasy with reality.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the participants of Group 3 were asked to carry out a &quot;reality check&quot;, comparing their fantasy with reality.<br /><br />Researchers found that the contrast technique was the most effective in encouraging people to make plans of action and in taking responsibility.<br /><br />Most advice out there points out that being positive and visualizing a positive outcome is helpful to reach our goals. (Think Law of Attraction, Think and Grow Rich or The Secret)<br /><br />But that by itself doesn't work according to the research.<br /><br />We need to do mental contrasting. And it's done like this:<br /><br />1. You imagine your ideal future. Everything you want, the longer you imagine the better.<br /><br />2. Come back to your current reality. This reality check phase can be quite painful and stressful depending on your current situation.<br /><br />Imagine you wanna lose 20 lbs of fat and start a business while in reality you currently don't even have money for rent.<br /><br />To go from your reality to the ideal outcome will be challenging.<br /><br />What the research has shown is that if you realize it's gonna be hard, and if you truly believe you can get there you can outperform people who think it's gonna be easy and ignore all the steps in the process.<br /><br />And with the contrasting technique, you clearly focus and outline the gap between fantasy and reality.<br /><br />In psychology, the gap is called &quot;Necessity to Act&quot;.<br /><br />This will immediately eliminate procrastination as it gives you a clear process to do.<br /><br />So to summarize:<br /><br />Think about your ideal, get fired up. Secondly, think about your current reality.<br /><br />And then think about what you need to do to close that gap and then go do it.<br /><br />Note: Why mental contrasting isn't for everyone.<br /><br />Doing a reality check sounds straightforward, but research shows it's not so simple.<br /><br />Our natural reaction is to avoid bringing fantasy and reality together because it’s uncomfortable.<br /><br />Psychologists call this Cognitive Dissonance: Our mind’s discomfort with thoughts and actions which are incompatible with each other.<br /><br />Suddenly it becomes obvious what needs to be done and these realizations can be stressful, even depressing for some people.<br /><br />Naturally, we want to keep thinking about happy things.<br /><br />Or if we’re thinking negative thoughts, it’s difficult to change to positive.<br /><br />It's not for most people but I know you can do it!<br /><br />Related studies: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11374746">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11374746</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22364109">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22364109</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/soco.2010.28.4.490">https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/soco.2010.28.4.490</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08870446.2011.626038#.VoWpRxUwihc">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08870446.2011.626038#.VoWpRxUwihc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20204943">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20204943</a><br /><br />Related Books:<br />Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation by Gabriele Oettingen<br /><br />For more fitness, nutrition and personal development tips check out:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MarioTomicOfficial">https://www.facebook.com/MarioTomicOfficial</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/mariotomich">https://instagram.com/mariotomich</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tomic.com">https://www.tomic.com</a><br /><br />Music:<br />Different Heaven &amp; EH!DE - My Heart [NCS Release]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK2aIUmmdP4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK2aIUmmdP4</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/different-heaven">https://soundcloud.com/different-heaven</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ehide-dubstep">https://soundcloud.com/ehide-dubstep</a>
