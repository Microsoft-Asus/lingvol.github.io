I've added Русские and English subtitles if you need them.<br />My question to you is... What is the smartest thing that you know?<br />Что самое умное ты знаешь?<br />I find the question very interesting:)<br /><br />Personally, I believe that understanding all the basic elements of evolution is the smartest thing that I know. It's not unique, lots of people know how evolution works, but it really is something fascinating and something to dedicate ones life to.<br /><br />Today I have decided to talk a little bit about evolution: about random mutations, about gene pools and selection, about medicine and modern diseases.<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Let's welcome Marina to the vlog. She has only made an appearance in a couple shots previously in the vlog, but now there is a good 3 minutes dedicated to my time spent with her.<br /><br />Noteworthy coffee places in Moscow:<br />1554<br />Skuratov<br />Double B на чистых прудах<br />Розетка и Кофе<br /><br />If everything goes well, I'm soon going to a couple places where there should be 1) forests 2) mountains. Drone footage perhaps?<br /><br />I really wish I could be uploading more often, but footage collection takes up a lot of time if nothing exciting happens in my life. Let me know if posting this rarely bothers you, please.<br /><br />Also, if you are in Moscow, I am currently curating a coffee shop list that you can view on my map. I found an amazing Instagram account with coffee shops (IG: @coffeeinmoscow), so my job is pretty much to place them on a map so it's easier for somebody to get around to find which one is closest to you: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foursquare.com/geolms/list/coffee-in-moscow">https://foursquare.com/geolms/list/coffee-in-moscow</a><br /><br />A viewer wrote a message to me on VK a week ago sending me some music and thence/she deleted our conversation. If you are reading this: SORRY, I didn't have time to respond! I'll gladly have a look at your music suggestions!<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Thank you so much for watching this vlog!<br /><br />■ Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/JAOyLG">http://goo.gl/JAOyLG</a><br />■ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/geolms/">https://www.instagram.com/geolms/</a><br />■ Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geolmsphotos.tumblr.com">http://geolmsphotos.tumblr.com</a><br />■ SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/geolms">https://soundcloud.com/geolms</a><br />■ Apple Music Profile: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/profile/geolms">https://itunes.apple.com/profile/geolms</a><br /><br />Music:<br />love-sadKiD - Carpet Ride (prod.
