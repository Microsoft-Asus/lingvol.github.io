The surface where they slip is called a Fault place.<br /><br />The location below the earth‚Äôs surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypo center, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.<br /><br />Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place before a larger earthquake takes place. The largest main earthquake is called the main shock. Main shocks are always followed by aftershocks that occur in the same place and can continue for weeks, months and even years after the main shock.<br /><br />Watch this animated video and learn more about What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?
