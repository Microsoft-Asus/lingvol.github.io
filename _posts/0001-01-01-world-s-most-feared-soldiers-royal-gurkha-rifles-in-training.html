The Royal Gurkha Rifles Regiment conducts field training in the final phase of Exercise Saber Strike. <br /><br />The Royal Gurkha Rifles (RGR) is a rifle regiment of the British Army, forming part of the Brigade of Gurkhas.<br /><br />Unlike other regiments in the British army, soldiers are recruited from Nepal, which is neither a dependent territory of the United Kingdom nor a member of the Commonwealth.<br /><br />The Gurkhas are a unique unit in the Army with a reputation of being amongst the finest and most feared soldiers in the world.
