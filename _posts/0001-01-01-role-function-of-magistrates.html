For today’s lecture, we are going to consider the role and function of magistrates in the English legal<br />system. Magistrates are also known as Justices of the Peace, and they have a long history in the English<br />legal system. Lay magistrates should be distinguished from Stipendiary Magistrates (now called District<br />Judges Magistrates’ Courts). The former are unpaid and part-time lay people, while the latter are<br />professionally qualified, salaried judges. This section will focus primarily on lay magistrates.<br />Lay magistrates have criminal and civil jurisdiction. In terms of their criminal capacity, magistrates hear<br />around 95 to 98 per cent of all criminal cases. This represents over a million cases each year, and as such<br />the significant contribution that they make to the administration of justice should not be understated.<br />To break their criminal workload even more: Magistrates deal with requests for search and arrest<br />warrants. They exercise a number of pre- trial judicial powers and hear applications for the grant of bail.<br />Magistrates also hear the evidence, reach a verdict and pass sentence, if a defendant is convicted.<br />Magistrates hear only summary offences and some triable- either-way offences. Magistrates have<br />limited sentencing powers, which include: sentences of up to 12 months in prison for one offence; up to<br />a £5,000 fine. Magistrates can also commit a person to be sentenced at the Crown Court if they feel that<br />their sentencing powers are insufficient.<br />Magistrates also have a considerable civil jurisdiction. They grant licenses. Magistrates hear appeals<br />from local authority decisions regarding a failure to grant a license, in respect of the sale of alcohol, or a<br />Hackney cab, or a betting/gaming license. They also have power of recovery in respect of non- payment<br />of council tax and non- payment of television licenses and hear family proceedings. This may include<br />applications for residence, applications for contact orders and adoption proceedings. Magistrates<br />hearing family proceedings receive specialist training.<br />There are a number of eligibility criteria to become a magistrate. Magistrates must be over 18 and under<br />65 years of age. They must live within 15 miles of the area in which they will work and must be able to<br />sit at least 26 half days per year. Police officers, members of the armed forces, and traffic wardens are<br />among the class of people disqualified from becoming a magistrate.<br />The Lord Chancellor appoints magistrates under the Justices of the Peace Act. In 1998 the procedures<br />for appointing magistrates were changed in order to make the appointment criteria more transparent. It<br />is now possible to make a direct application to become a magistrate. The job description for a<br />magistrate identifies six qualities:<br />- good character<br />- social awareness
