My first full animated infographic and the largest project I have ever taken on. 4 months of researching, calculating, writing, illustrating, animating, and editing.<br /><br />Climate change is a real and serious issue. In this animated infographic we dive into the science behind human accelerated climate change, how it is affecting our planet, why we need to act on this issue, and how you as an individual can contribute to the solution.<br /><br />References:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">https://climate.nasa.gov/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://epa.gov">https://epa.gov</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thesolutionsproject.org">https://thesolutionsproject.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cei.org">https://cei.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://climatechangeaustralia.gov.au">https://climatechangeaustralia.gov.au</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://c2es.org">https://c2es.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nrdc.org">https://nrdc.org</a><br /><br />Written/Illustrated/Animated/Created by Matt Miltonberger<br /><br />➡Website Portfolio: www.mattmiltonberger.com<br />➡Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/matt_milt">https://www.twitter.com/matt_milt</a><br />➡Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/matt_milt">https://www.instagram.com/matt_milt</a>
