Aviation has come a long way since 1903, when the Wright Brothers' Flyer-1 aircraft first took to the skies. Flying machines have set incredible records one after the other. The first flight stayed up for just 12 seconds and flew 120 feet. But this was a true revolution!<br /><br />Todayâ€™s aircrafts have by far higher performance. For example, the Bombardier Global 7500 has a range of 7,700 nautical miles, while the Lockheed SR-71A can reach speeds of 2,193 miles per hour. But we have an aviation record holder. It has broken about 240 staggering world records!<br />This air titan doesn't take off, rather it pushes the ground away. It's not an airplane, but the Dream!
