This may look easy but it is actually a difficult trick to teach your dog. They were un easy at first going through the hoop but after each phase they soon were comfortable enough to jump through! Next time we will have to try and get them through the higher hoop but this was a great start! Let us know if you want to see more of these type of videos!  New Videos every week. Enjoy and Thanks for watching! :)<br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAI5QLNSOSzOQTYCyNA06EQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAI5QLNSOSzOQTYCyNA06EQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Don’t Forget New Videos Every Week! :)<br /><br /><br />If you want to send anything that will be in our mail opening video (letters, artwork, toys, etc) Send it here:<br />P.O.
