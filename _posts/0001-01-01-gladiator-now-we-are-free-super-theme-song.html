I combined &quot;Honor Him&quot;, &quot;Elysium&quot;, and &quot;Now We Are Free&quot; into one song.<br /><br />This was pretty simple to do, the only editing required was to blend them together and rearrange &quot;Elysium&quot; and &quot;Honor Him&quot; and &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;.<br /><br />Check out my channel for other super theme songs.<br /><br />Click on the link to see a video of my audio edtor and the transitions between songs.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/xXjiiSV8Q6g">http://youtu.be/xXjiiSV8Q6g</a>
