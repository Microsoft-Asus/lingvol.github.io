What is Meaning of Education? Derivation Explained  Information Video<br /><br />Etymologically, the word education is derived from educare (Latin) &quot;bring up&quot;, which is related to educere &quot;bring out&quot;, &quot;bring forth what is within&quot;, &quot;bring out potential&quot; and ducere, &quot;to lead&quot;. <br />Webster defines education as the process of educating or teaching (now that's really useful, isn't it?) <br />Educate is further defined as &quot;to develop the knowledge, skill, or character of...&quot; Thus, from these definitions, we might assume that the purpose of education is to develop the knowledge, skill, or character of students.<br />In ancient Greece, Socrates argued that education was about drawing out what was already within the student. (As many of you know, the word education comes from the Latin e-ducere meaning &quot;to lead out.&quot;)<br />At the same time, the Sophists, a group of itinerant teachers, promised to give students the necessary knowledge and skills to gain positions with the city-state. Thus we see that there are different views and understandings of the meaning of the term education. <br />In the modern times it has acquired two different shades of meaning namely: an institutional instruction, given to students in school colleges formally; and a pedagogical science, studied by the student of education.<br />--------------------------------------------<br />AFFILIATE LINK:<br />Make Money with Clickbank: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2SSrGJO">https://bit.ly/2SSrGJO</a><br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Mantra:<br />Information is Opportunity.<br />Knowledge is Power.<br />Be Informed - Be Powerful!<br /><br />SUPPORT US:<br />SUBSCRIBE / LIKE / SHARE / COMMENT :)<br />Subscribe Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/qbyzFb">https://goo.gl/qbyzFb</a><br />.......<br /><br />CONNECT US:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.simplyinfo.net">http://www.simplyinfo.net</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SimplyInfo.net">https://www.facebook.com/SimplyInfo.net</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SimplyInfo9">https://twitter.com/SimplyInfo9</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SimplyInfo9">https://www.youtube.com/c/SimplyInfo9</a><br />Slideshare: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.slideshare.net/SimplyInfo9">https://www.slideshare.net/SimplyInfo9</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://in.pinterest.com/SimplyInfo9/">https://in.pinterest.com/SimplyInfo9/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/simplyinfo9/">https://www.instagram.com/simplyinfo9/</a><br />YouTube Subscribe Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/qbyzFb">https://goo.gl/qbyzFb</a><br />.......<br /><br />OTHER PLAYLISTS TO EXPLORE:<br />Games &amp; Sports: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/uTXRWB">https://goo.gl/uTXRWB</a><br />Jobs &amp; Career Info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/cbCDXy">https://goo.gl/cbCDXy</a><br />Business Management: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/1sDjfW">https://goo.gl/1sDjfW</a><br />Information Technology: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nWYpK8">https://goo.gl/nWYpK8</a><br />Physics Concepts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/FnLmes">https://goo.gl/FnLmes</a><br />Education &amp; Learning: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/54TR8A">https://goo.gl/54TR8A</a><br />Filmmaking Concepts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/RQL5qn">https://goo.gl/RQL5qn</a><br />Psychology Concepts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/oYNNKA">https://goo.gl/oYNNKA</a><br />Indian Law Concepts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/m98pWn">https://goo.gl/m98pWn</a><br />Economics Concepts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/yymX98">https://goo.gl/yymX98</a><br />.......<br /><br />About Simplyinfo.net:<br />We provide the best info bytes videos in a very simple and effective way to learn, to revise and to master micro-content information.
