My CFI, Matt, with PrecisionAire Aviation (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEnvcgRMQHxCotv9W0QczA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEnvcgRMQHxCotv9W0QczA</a> ) and I decided to take advantage of the less than ideal weather to practice some approaches. Looking at the map, KDBQ, Dubuque had the worst forecast, so that is where we went! This wasn't my first time in actual IMC at night, but the first time shooting an approach through it!<br /><br />We setup for the VOR rwy 31 approach and encountered ceiling down to minimums! After a short hold however, the weather changed for the better!<br /><br />Enjoy the many nuggets of wisdom Matt adds, especially on the Garmin G530, and see me poorly fly an airplane. Still getting a feel for audio recording so bare with me!<br /><br />Index:<br />0:32 Going over our flight plan and entering in the G530 <br />2:18 Calling Clearance and Ground<br />4:15 A proper pre departure briefing<br />7:29 Take off! and going enroute in IMC<br />10:30 Briefing the approach (sorry for bad audio!)<br />16:00 Approaching the Initial Approach Fix (IAF)<br />17:30 Getting close to flying one nasty looking procedure turn<br />20:00 Getting sloppy in IMC, getting close to the Final Approach Fix (FAF)<br />21:10 Getting down to minimums! Going Missed<br />26:00 going to the hold and planning our next approach, discussing limitations on G530 <br />31:48 Briefing the RNAV 13 KDBQ<br />38:09 Final Approach Fix RNAV13 ( I am doing this under the hood)<br />39:45 Land or no?<br /><br />Items used in making this video:<br />Audio Recorder <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HyUtgr">https://amzn.to/2HyUtgr</a><br />GoPro Hero 7 (cockpit view) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34bXay3">https://amzn.to/34bXay3</a><br />GoPro Hero 6 (front windshield view) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MKlPVk">https://amzn.to/2MKlPVk</a>
