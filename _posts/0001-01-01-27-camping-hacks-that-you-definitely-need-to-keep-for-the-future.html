{% raw %}GENIUS CAMPING TRICKS FOR THE TIME YOU SPEND IN THE WILDERNESS <br /><br /><br /><br />In this video, I show you some genius ideas that will make your camping a lot more fun. You can create your own useful crafts from things you already have to make your life easier in nature. <br /><br />I show you how to make your own outdoor toilet using a plastic bucket, a plastic bag and then a toilet seat on top. <br /><br />I show you how to make a water filter using carbon and layers of cotton pads. Just make sure you boil the water before drinking to get rid of all the bacteria. <br /><br />For an easy and full-filling lunch, remove the inside of a potato, fill it up with eggs and season, then bake in some fire and Bon appetite. <br /><br />Take a plastic bottle and cut it from the middle to make a toilet roll container. This will help you keep it dry and prevent it from being damaged. <br /><br />To open a tin can simply rub it on the floor. The friction will lift the top part of the container and you can open it easily after that. <br /><br />To keep your sandwiches and packed food fresh, place it in a resealable bag and then suck all the air out. You can keep it fresh for days. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps: <br /><br />0:22 – DIY hammock<br /><br />2:20 – Delicious dinner idea<br /><br />4:26 – Amazing camping tricks for beginners<br /><br />7:17 – How to keep your food fresh<br /><br />9:19 – DIY waterproof shoes<br /><br />12:17 – No frying pan?
