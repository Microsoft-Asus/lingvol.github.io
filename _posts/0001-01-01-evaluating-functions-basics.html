Five worked-out examples demonstrating the basics of evaluating functions at a given value. For example: find f(2) when f(x) = 3x + 1. Be sure to pay attention to the last example, which is a classic trouble-spot for algebra students (double negative).<br /><br />Recorded with ScreenFlow, Acorn, and a Wacom tablet.
