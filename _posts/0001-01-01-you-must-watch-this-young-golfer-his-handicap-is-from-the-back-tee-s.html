The Golfing Legend OMP shares Expert Golf Advice on Course Management, Chipping Perfectly and getting More Spin without thinning or duffing the shot. Top Golf tips on Golf Club choice and Golf Shot type.

For entertainment purposes I try out Golf Accessories and Golf Products and see if they can improve my performance or if they are in fact just a â€˜Fadâ€™.<br /><br />If you would like to become a part of the most active golf community on YouTube please hit the subscribe button and the notification bell to never miss a video and keep yourself entertained with all your golfing needs!<br /><br />#Subscribe #HitTheBell #GolfMates
