I’m often asked by sales professionals, is there such thing as a perfect sales call? I’d argue there is indeed. 2 questions I get my clients to ask themselves after each call are:<br /><br />What’s the most I could have taken and achieved from that call?<br />What did I get and achieve from that call?
