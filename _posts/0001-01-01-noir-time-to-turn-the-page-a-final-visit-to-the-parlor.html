Our good friends Dave and Scott offered us their valuable time, equipment, and expertise so that we could capture Noir as it was meant to be seen one last time before we close the parlor doors at the end of 2020 to focus our efforts on the next chapter. We are blown away by their work and can't thank them enough.<br /><br />We are so immensely grateful to every person, living or dead, that has walked through our doors over the last 6 and half years. The joy and love that you've brought to my life by being a part of this weird little community is immeasurable and will never be forgotten.<br /><br />This is not the end, it's just the end of this chapter. We're writing the next one now. Stay tuned ... and stay strange.<br /><br />Pam Smith<br />Owner &amp; Curator<br />Noir Arts &amp; Oddities<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://noirartsandoddities.com">http://noirartsandoddities.com</a><br /><br />Video Credits:<br />Dave Simmons / Thill Media<br />Scott Jolley / SJPS<br /><br />Please, please, please take some time to check out Dave and Scott's work with their respective organizations.
