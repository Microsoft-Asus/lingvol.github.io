This is a clothing song written specially for my ESL Youtube channel by Julia Hetman - my fellow English teacher living in Kramatorsk, Ukraine. This cute song can make an English lesson more exciting and engaging for preschoolers and early school kids learning English clothes vocabulary. I hope educators and children from all over the world will enjoy this cute and simple song.<br /><br />You can find this clothing song lyrics as well as corresponding worksheets, flashcards, coloring pages and tips on how to make use of the song during your English lessons on my blog at : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://english4kids-step-by-step.blogspot.com/2015/04/clothing-song-for-kids.html">http://english4kids-step-by-step.blogspot.com/2015/04/clothing-song-for-kids.html</a><br /><br />Clothes Song Lyrics:<br />Who is wearing a scarf?<br />Can’t you see? It’s a giraffe.<br />Who is wearing a hat?<br />It’s a funny brown bat.<br /><br />Who is wearing a skirt?<br />It’s a little hummingbird.<br />Who is wearing a shirt?<br />It is just a mockingbird.<br /><br />Are you wearing a dress?<br />If you’re a girl, say: “Yes!”<br />Are you wearing corduroys?<br />Say: “Yes, we are!” if you are boys.<br /><br />Credits:<br />Lyrics: Julia Hetman<br />Vocal: Hande Burdg (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.15hifi.com/hande/">http://www.15hifi.com/hande/</a> , <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/hburdg/session-singer-with-four-octaves)">https://www.fiverr.com/hburdg/session-singer-with-four-octaves)</a><br />Music: Olga Nesterov<br />Animation: Dmitriy Nesterov
