The 'Play as Anyone' system helps give life to the characters within Ubisoft Toronto's Watch Dogs: Legion.  Now they're no longer just background NPC civilians wandering the world, they're fleshed-out characters with backstories and lives that continue on even when not in the players view.  But they can also become part of your Dedsec crew, and this requires players to dive into their personal lives to find out more about them and how they can help them with their own issues.<br /><br />In this feature-length documentary episode of AI and Games, we sit down with three members of the development team and explore how 'Play as Anyone' works in Watch Dogs Legion.  We find out about the games early inspirations, the complexity of procedural character generation, how real-time mission generation wors, the numerous systems that help manage a simulated London full of NPCs and the challenges faced along the way.<br /><br />Chapters<br />[00:00] Intro<br />[02:53] Play as Anyone<br />[07:49] Simulating London<br />[16:21] Procedural Character Generation<br />[27:08] Realtime Mission Generation<br />[34:34] Enriching the Open World<br />[42:26] Closing<br /><br />--<br />AI and Games is a YouTube series on research and applications of Artificial Intelligence in video games.
