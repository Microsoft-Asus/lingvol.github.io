New York Post columnist Miranda Devine says “numerous instances” of voter fraud have been identified in US swing states.<br /><br />“Everything from Trump ballots being found discarded in a river to irregularities, signature verification failures,” Ms Devine told Sky News host Alan Jones.  <br /><br />“Mail-in ballot are known to be vulnerable to fraud and this was an election with a record number of ballots.”<br /><br />Ms Devine said the democratic machines in cities such as Atlanta, Detroit and Philadelphia used the pandemic to change the rules around voting and then they performed “industrial scale ballot harvesting”. <br /><br />“So, whether it was illegal or legal, it was still absolutely unfair,” she said.
