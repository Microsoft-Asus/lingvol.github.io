{% raw %}*click HD for better viewing*<br />Welcome to C. Jangmi channel! I know being a forced online student during this pandemic is so stressing. May we all not forget to pause and take a break. Unwind and relax my dear hardworking fellas, please don't be too hard on yourselves. I hope you enjoy watching as I bring you with me in this week's unwinding sesh. <br /><br />Please take your vitamins, always wash your hands, sanitize and use clean face masks. Take Care always!<br /><br />love,<br />C.
