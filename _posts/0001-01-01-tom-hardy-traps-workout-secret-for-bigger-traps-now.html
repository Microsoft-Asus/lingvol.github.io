More than just bigger traps - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://athleanx.com/x/tomhardytraps">http://athleanx.com/x/tomhardytraps</a><br /><br />One of the most overlooked muscles when it comes to direct training, or at least correct direct training is the traps or trapezius muscles.  Regardless of what traps workout you're following, perhaps nobody personifies the kind of towering traps that you can get with the right traps workout than Batman and Warrior actor Tom Hardy.  The guy literally looks like he is smuggling sandbags in his upper back and neck!<br /><br />But how did he develop such an impressive set of huge traps?<br /><br />From doing trap exercises the right way...by contracting the traps on every rep of shrugs and not just lifting the bar from point A to point B.  There is a huge difference in the activation of the traps muscles when you simply lift your shoulders upwards during a shrug and when you contract and pinch your shoulder blades back at the same time that you lift.  <br /><br />Watch the demonstration in this video and see how much more active the traps muscles are when this is done correctly and how much more effective you can make your traps workout if you start doing them this way.<br /><br />Also remember that when you're performing your shrugs, it's always better to do slightly less weight and use dumbbells to ensure a good contraction in your traps than it is to use a barbell, and get blocked from reaching full contraction.  You'll see much better results from your workouts if you do.<br /><br />Speaking of workouts, if you're looking for a complete workout program that makes sure you don't miss out on any of the important elements of training, then head over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://athleanx.com">http://athleanx.com</a> and get celebrity trainer Jeff Cavaliere's ATHLEAN-X Training System!
