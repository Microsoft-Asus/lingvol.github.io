Featuring Lynn Gunn of Paris<br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://riserecords.merchnow.com/search/?q=loss+for+words">http://riserecords.merchnow.com/search/?q=loss+for+words</a><br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/al4w-before-it-caves">http://smarturl.it/al4w-before-it-caves</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I've been dreaming of your face I see it clearer still 8 thousand miles away.<br />And even as the seasons change there's always one thing that remains,<br />I know this image of you will never start to fade.<br />Never start to fade.<br />If you find yourself alone I hope you know I'm by your side.<br />If you're scared you're losing hope, just hang on til I arrive.<br />Because I know what we both know that whatever distance I might go.<br />Whatever distance I might go, I'm only one phone call from home.<br />So don't forget or second guess, that all these nights you've never slept,<br />that every night after I left, your name was on my breath.<br />I know its hard to be this far. <br />Feels like we're half a world apart.<br />It's the challenges we face that make us who we are.<br />That makes us what we are.<br />You will always, you will always have my heart.
