Abstract: The discussion will focus on the Azerbaijan-Turkey-Jihadists war perpetrated against the Artsakh people, its consequences and implications. Outlined will be: 1) The potential benefits to Russia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan; 2) The steps that are necessary for Armenia to revamp its military and political status in the Caucasus; 3) Whether or not Moscow will opt to recommit to its Armenian security guarantee as a bulwark against further projection of Turkish power in the region. Further, the presentation will also address the possible outcomes for Armenia, future political and economic problems that may arise, as well as the status of the current Government of Armenia and the future of the ruling political party.<br /><br />Eric Hacopian was born in Iran and graduated from UCLA, specializing in political science.
