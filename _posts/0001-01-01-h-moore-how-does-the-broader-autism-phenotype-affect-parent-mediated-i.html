Presentation given by Heather Moore from Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, (United Kingdom) at the Autism-Europe's 12th International Congress 2019: &quot;A New Dynamic for Change and Inclusion&quot;, held the 13-15th September 2019 in Nice, France.<br /><br />Introduction<br />Broader autism phenotype (BAP) describes sub-diagnostic<br />threshold traits of autism found in family members of autistic<br />people. BAP includes difficulties in language, social skills and rigidity. Parent-mediated interventions can benefit autistic children but very little research has investigated how parent BAP may affect<br />outcomes. One small pilot study (n=18, Parr et al., 2015) showed a<br />significant negative correlation between BAP and mother-child interaction post-intervention. This study reports a larger sample with a control group to investigate how parent BAP affects outcomes of parent-mediated intervention.<br /><br />Methods<br />Data were from PACT7-11, a follow up (FU, median 5.75 years<br />from PACT trial endpoint (mean age=10.5years, SD=0.8)) of a<br />parent-mediated social communication intervention RCT with 2-4<br />year old autistic children. Family History Interview-Subject (FHI-S)<br />measured parent BAP (assumed stable) and was applied retrospectively for analysis. Blinded endpoint and FU outcomes were treated as multivariate pairs: ADOS comparative severity scores (CSS), Dyadic Communication Measure for Autism (DCMA) proportion of parent acts synchronous with child attention (DCMA<br />Parent Synchrony), and DCMA proportion of child initiations to<br />the parent (DCMA Child Initiations). We used full information maximum likelihood structural equation modelling in STATA to adjust for baseline outcome value and treatment group, then examined the main effect and moderator of treatment effect of âˆš-transformed FHI-S on each outcome.<br /><br />Results<br />121 (80%) of the 152 trial participants (PACT intervention=59/77<br />(77%), Control=62/75 (83%)) completed follow up. Of these, FHI-S<br />scores were available for 102 participants (PACT intervention=49,<br />Control=53). Strong group effects on all outcomes (p.001) published previously were identified (Pickles et al., 2016). FHI-S score was not correlated with baseline ADOS CSS, DCMA Parental Synchrony, or DCMA Child Initiations. FHI-S had no effect on outcome ADOS CSS or DCMA Parent Synchrony but had a marginally significant main effect (p=.079) and moderation effect (p=.097) on DCMA Child Initiations.<br /><br />Discussion<br />In this sample, BAP had a limited role in outcomes following parent-mediated intervention. The lack of finding may be specific to the behaviours targeted by the PACT therapy and the relatively low FHI-S scores of PACT parents. More information is needed to understand how to tailor interventions to parents, children and environments.
