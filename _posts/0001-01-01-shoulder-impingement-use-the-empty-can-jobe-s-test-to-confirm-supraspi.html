<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bodymaster-method.mykajabi.com/shoulder-masterclass">https://bodymaster-method.mykajabi.com/shoulder-masterclass</a><br />John Gibbons is a registered Osteopath, Lecturer and Multi-published Author and in this video he will be teaching you how to assess the shoulder for impingement of the suprapsinatus muscle using the empty and full can test - also known as the Jobe's test. This is taken from his Vital Shoulder Complex Online Course. <br /><br />In the Vital Shoulder Complex Masterclass osteopath, author and respected bodywork specialist John Gibbons looks at one of the most neglected areas of the body: the shoulder complex. During the online course he will take you on a fascinating journey of enlightenment, teaching you to recognise pain and dysfunctional patterns that can arise from dysfunctions found within this complex region of the upper limb.<br /><br />You’ll learn how to identify specific soft tissue dysfunction and even weaknesses found within the gluteal &amp; psoas musculo-skeletal system, and to harness powerful Muscle Energy Techniques (METs) and specific exercises to restore function to your athletes and patients.<br /><br />Lessons such as functional anatomy and the biomechanics of the shoulder and cervical spine are discussed and the link to the walking cycle, pelvis and even the gluteal &amp; psoas muscles and how they relate to pain and dysfunction to distant sites of the body. Once that has been understood, he takes you on a fascinating journey to functionally assess the shoulder, cervical spine and also the firing patterns of the Gmax and Gmed as well as specific muscle length tests that can alter the position of the pelvis and lumbar spine, which effects the relationship to the upper limb.<br /><br />How does a gall bladder problem cause referred pain to the shoulder?<br />Why might pain in the superior aspect of the scapula be linked to a weak gluteus maximus muscle on the opposite side?<br />A winged scapula can be caused by damage to which nerve?<br />How would you treat a SLAP lesion?<br />How does the gait pattern contribute to pain and dysfunction of the shoulder region? <br />How can the application of gluteal-psoas-specific Muscle Energy Techniques aid full-body well-being?<br /><br />The text that compliments the course contains over 350 colour photographs and illustrations and insightful case studies from his own practice, Gibbons provides an educative tour of the anatomy of the shoulder complex and demonstrates treatment protocols proven to successfully restore pain free movement and improve sporting performance.<br /><br />Once you have studied all of the anatomy, pathology and all of the various assessment techniques, you will then learn how to correct any of the dysfunctions found within this framework through the application of myofascial soft tissue techniques, athletic taping and k-taping modalities as well as specific METs, and finally utilising the most current research based shoulder exercises to restore normality.<br /><br />On completion of the course you will have the knowledge and practical experience necessary to identify, assess and treat specific pathologies found within the shoulder, &amp; cervical spine musculo-skeletal framework and perform a variety of techniques that will help promote function.<br />The Bodymaster Method® is accredited by the Sports Therapy Organisation (STO)<br /><br />John also hosts Certified &amp; accredited online courses and these are accessible from your own home.
