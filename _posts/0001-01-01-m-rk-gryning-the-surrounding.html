{% raw %}Desolation of mankind, from the horizon<br />you can hear them ride<br />Towards the damned village<br />Mighty warriors waiting for the sign of war<br />The bloodred moon above us guides us forth<br />Raise the swords of hatred, execute with darkest power<br />Screams and cries will be all you hear<br /><br />Permeate bodies with our swords<br />Resurrect evil souls, drain human bodies of blood<br /><br />I am the strongest one, my powers are<br />granted by the darkest sources<br />I am the ancient to doom your life, I will<br />rule in infinity<br /><br />Hail mighty warriors!<br />Devastate life one by one<br /><br />A battlefield with dead bodies are all that remains<br />Fifteen days of rain and our victory's eternal<br /><br />Resurrection of evil, an army from the tomb<br />Pain and grief shall be, eternal darkness come<br /><br />Surrounded by the darkest troops and you'll die{% endraw %}
