Earlier this week I had the pleasure to visit Liz and Mr J over at Byther Farm! I have been following their progress on their fantastic YouTube channel and I am amazed at how productive their set-up is. So I went down for a day to visit and had an amazing time and I can assure you that I will be back! This video gives a good insight into what goes on, but you should definitely subscribe to their YouTube channel to follow their progress: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0Ha5QljsCV5UqIkobBrcQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0Ha5QljsCV5UqIkobBrcQ</a><br />Liz's Instagram: liz_zorab_byther_farm<br /><br />Instagram: @huws_nursery<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HuwsGardenNursery">https://www.facebook.com/HuwsGardenNursery</a><br /><br />Seed sponsor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.organiccatalogue.com">https://www.organiccatalogue.com</a><br />Tool sponsor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bulldogtools.co.uk">https://www.bulldogtools.co.uk</a><br /><br />Main Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KCbn0k">https://amzn.to/2KCbn0k</a><br />Second Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KkRoUA">https://amzn.to/2KkRoUA</a><br />Laptop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KjT4hj">https://amzn.to/2KjT4hj</a><br />Drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2tUYZy6">https://amzn.to/2tUYZy6</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KvTikz">https://amzn.to/2KvTikz</a><br />Second Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2yXuRYJ">https://amzn.to/2yXuRYJ</a><br />Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2lQ77g1">https://amzn.to/2lQ77g1</a><br /><br />HuwsNursery is a channel which dedicates itself to teaching you how to grow an abundance of food at your home.
