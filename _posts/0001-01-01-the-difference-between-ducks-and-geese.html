{% raw %}Let me explain the difference between ducks and geese. And can ducks and geese live together? We raise both ducks and geese on our farm and I have observed some incredible things that make them very different animals.<br /><br />About Gold Shaw Farm: Gold Shaw Farm is more of a farm-in-progress than an honest-to-goodness farm. Our dream is that someday we are able to transform our 150+ acre parcel of land into a regenerative and productive homestead and farm.<br /><br />Do you want to buy Gold Shaw Farm t-shirts and other merchandise?
