In this video I‚Äôll walk you through the exact rules that make up an extremely profitable Bitcoin trading strategy that I use repeatedly every single month.<br /><br />The forex strategy, cryptocurrency strategy etc provides us with one simple, repeatable, and more importantly profitable trade at the start of every period, and can easily be moulded to fit your Bitcoin investment outlook, or be carried into many other markets whether it‚Äôs currency trading, forex trading, stock trading etc.<br /><br />‚ñ∫ Learn My Strategies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wbtrading.co.uk/join-my-community/">https://wbtrading.co.uk/join-my-community/</a><br /><br />If you're new to the way I trade, I use mechanical rule-based strategies, or in other words I wait for my setup to form, I place the trade and walk away. Set and forget.<br /><br />What amazes me is that so many traders out there don't even know this way of trading exists, they think you have to guess, predict and blindly hope for the best when trading, whereas I look for repeating price patterns and setups within markets and before ever placing a trade I test these, often going back through the charts by-hand across years of data and I prove that the setup offers an opportunity to profit regularly by building statistics on the performance of each setup and when this is done, I then implement rules, create a strategy and trade the setup/s.<br /><br />Genuinely, trading CAN be this easy...<br /><br />If you have any questions, please just comment below and I'll respond to you right away.<br /><br />I'll look forward to hearing from you, and thanks for watching!<br /><br />üåê Visit My Website ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wbtrading.co.uk/">http://www.wbtrading.co.uk/</a><br /><br />üìö Best Trading Books ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BestTradingBooks">http://bit.ly/BestTradingBooks</a><br /><br />üìß Contact me ‚ñ∫ william@wbtrading.co.uk<br /><br />üîµ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/WBTrading">http://www.twitter.com/WBTrading</a><br /><br />Disclaimer:<br /><br />All content is for informational purposes only.
