As Pres. Trump is under fire for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus, medical experts are increasingly correcting the President in public – including at his own White House press conferences. In this report, MSNBC anchor Ari Melber reports that Pres. Trump largely canceled the longstanding tradition of press briefings – part of his efforts to &quot;undercut the free press&quot; – which the White House only restored amid the pandemic. The briefings now include experts, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, clarifying and correcting assertions Trump makes from the lectern. Pulitzer-Prize Winning Columnist Eugene Robinson says Fauci is a key “trusted voice” for the nation, while Melber applies a Jay-Z lyric to Fauci's and Trump's dynamic – one is &quot;just the facts&quot; while the other just &quot;adjusts the facts.&quot; (This interview is from MSNBC’s “The Beat with Ari Melber, a news show covering politics, law and culture airing nightly at 6pm ET on MSNBC. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thebeatwithari.com).">http://www.thebeatwithari.com).</a> Aired on 3/24/20.<br />» Subscribe to MSNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.msnbc.com/SubscribeTomsnbc">http://on.msnbc.com/SubscribeTomsnbc</a><br /><br />MSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of politics headlines, as well as commentary and informed perspectives.
