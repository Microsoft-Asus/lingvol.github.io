#figurative #collage #women<br /><br />Denise Adler sets out to create portraits and dreamscapes that express the mythic and legendary. These pieces, both personal and archetypical, memorialize a moment in time.Her mixed media work often takes the form of drawing, painting and collage. Magazines, photographs and found materials factor in and become the story within the story.Her recent solo show “In Quintessence” examined identity, it’s reflection in contemporary culture-the multifaceted connections between the internal; external and virtual, distilled into hybrid creations, illustrating a deeper sense of reality.<br /><br />NYC based, she studied with artist Juanita McNeely in the 1970s and is influenced by Feminist Art and Expressionism. She attended Buffalo State University for 2 years where she studied printmaking. She graduated from Hofstra University with a degree in Fine Arts.<br /><br />CURRENT &amp; FUTURE EXHIBITIONS Friends of Pleiades Invitational - December 27 - January 16, 2019 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World, Pleiades Gallery Members Show, March 20 - April 13, 2019 OPENING RECEPTION Saturday, March 23, 3-6PM Illuminations: A Solo Show by DJA, February 19 - March 16 // Pleiades Gallery 530 W25th St., Ste 406.
