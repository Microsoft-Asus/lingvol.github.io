In this video, I attempt to quantify all the ways that particles move relative to each other. I then proceed to map out all the doppler and relativity equations corrections associated with each case. Mapping it out this way should help demystify any and all contradictions and paradoxes that are normally associated with relativity. <br /><br />Long story short, there are no paradoxes. <br /><br />Here is a link to Robert Distinti's video that I mentioned in this video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YYQI3F6iX_0">https://youtu.be/YYQI3F6iX_0</a>
