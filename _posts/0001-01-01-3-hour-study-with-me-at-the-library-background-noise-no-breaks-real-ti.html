Study with me at the University of Glasgow's library in real-time! At the 9th floor. You can enjoy the view at the beginning of the video. From the 9th floor at the library, the main campus is perfectly seen. If you would like to see much more campus view from the library; please, let me know on comments. I would gladly share it with you :)<br /><br />I also wonder what type of videos you like, study at the library or study at home? Your opinions are quite important for me; and, if you let me know what type of videos you like to watch, I would be happy. <br /><br />I hope that this study video helps you avoid using social media during the study. You can also find a library ambience in this video when studying at your home. I hope this would get you more motivated for studying. ASMR <br /><br />What I have studied today: EU Energy Security.<br /><br />Frequently asked questions: I am an International Relations Master of Research student at the University of Glasgow. I am currently living in Glasgow, Scotland.<br /><br />Instagram: @merveenroute<br /><br />#studywithMerve #studyatlibrary #realtimestudysession
