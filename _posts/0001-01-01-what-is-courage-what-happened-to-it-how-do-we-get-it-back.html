Courage is a very powerful and important emotional feeling that helps human beings survive and even thrive through all types of pain and challenges. Courage helps us build tolerance for adversity and strength from climbing what once seemed insurmountable and downright scary. The term is often used to refer to people who are being completely fearless, but it is used best to describe the moment when people recognize, accept, find the source of, and act (or not act) on their fears. Courage is intimately connected with morality. In a world that is led by the least moral people among us, the use of the word courage has become highly vulgarized. At some point, courage started to get very confusing for a lot of us. Now, we may start to think that courage is reserved for the few and powerful, and not for the many. However, cowardice can never be moral and cowardice can never be courage.<br /><br />Courage is just as much a philosophical concept as it is a psychological one, and different civilizations, authors, and psychologists have described courageous people differently. Individuals who express a lot of courage frequently appear fearless but may actually experience high levels of fear; in these scenarios, the fear doesnâ€™t act as a deterrent to facing challenging obstacles. Examples of courageous acts might include a person facing his or her rapist in court, an individual registering for the army, or someone asking his or her boss for a raise.<br /><br />#courageous #courage #strong #motivation #couragequotes #couragetochange #love #brave #courageouswomen #couragetogrow #strength #courageovercomfort #courageworks #inspire #basicgoodness #hope #selfdoubt #quotestagram #success #doubt #healthyliving #peace #couragemylove #inspiration #faithfulness #ghandi #neverdoubtself #blessed #fearless
