Then it suffered the same fate as many startups at the time, with the firm declaring bankruptcy in 2011. <br /><br />But now it's back - and on Friday last week it announced specifications and pricing for the newer, more efficient, more powerful reincarnation of the car that looks like it's from the future. <br /><br />We look at the company's history, examine what's changed... and explain why Nikki just put herself on the waitlist to own one. <br /><br />Watch the video above to find out more, support us with the provided links, and let us know what you think below -- but remember to keep your comments civil! <br /><br />Presenter: Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield<br />Produced: Transport Evolved
