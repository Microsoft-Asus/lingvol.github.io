I hoped to put all my years working in the fashion industry to good use. How to style outfits and advice and fashion tips on how to get the most out of your own capsule wardrobe. I love discovering new brands, designers and affordable high street fashion, but I always veer towards the more sustainable fashion and ethical brands. I try to buy well, I want my and your clothes to last as long as possible. <br />I love effortless, timeless style and share how I create that along the way. x<br /><br />#shopwithme #aninebing #anthropologie{% endraw %}
