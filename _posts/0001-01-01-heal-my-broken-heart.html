The song is also downloadable at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Beginnings-Noteworthy-Christian-Music/dp/B076Q49YNZ">https://www.amazon.com/New-Beginnings-Noteworthy-Christian-Music/dp/B076Q49YNZ</a>   If you or someone you know is experiencing grief and loss, perhaps this song can help. This moving expression of grief towards God is astoundingly honest, a faithful outpouring of emotion with an underpinning of Biblical truth. We can learn to rely on God even through the seriously tough times. Remember that God hears your cries, understands your pain, and is there to comfort and console you. May this song give you a way to help voice the deepest hurts to our heavenly Father. My prayer for you is that He will bring you hope and healing in every way. Know that God is there for you, and even named His Holy Spirit the 'Comforter' so you could always go to Him as a child goes to their Daddy when they are hurt. He is always available to comfort the cries of His children. <br />Visit  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://noteworthychristianmusic.com/heal-my-broken-heart">http://noteworthychristianmusic.com/heal-my-broken-heart</a> for the MP3, Back-up Track, and Sheet music to this and other great Christian music.
