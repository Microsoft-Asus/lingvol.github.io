How to know how good your eyes are? Nowadays, there are lots of gadgets around us. We stare at our computers and mobile phones all day, every day, and of course this affects our vision. How many people feel their eyes aching at the end of the day, or have blurry vision and eye dryness? All of these symptoms can indicate ophthalmic problems.There are a variety of vision deficiencies: colorblindness, near- and farsightedness, and astigmatism are the most common problems. Sometimes, a person doesn’t even know they have these issues — they just think that everyone sees this way.<br /><br />So do you wanna find out exactly how good your vision is and what you can do to improve it? We have a little test for you. You have to complete 9 simple tasks. Don’t forget to add one point to your score for every correct answer. Let's start!<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />Question #1 0:54<br />Question #2 1:28<br />Question #3 2:05<br />Question #4 2:44<br />Question #5 3:15<br />Question #6 3:49<br />Question #7 4:26<br />Question #8 5:01<br />Question #9 5:36<br />Exercise #1 6:55<br />Exercise #2 7:23<br />Exercise #3 8:02<br />Exercise #4 8:35<br />Exercise #5 9:13<br /><br />#goodeyesight #eyemassage #eyeproblems<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a> <br /><br />SUMMARY: <br />- It's always better to gradually increase the difficulty of the exercises, so make sure to start with simple blinking! Keep your eyes closed for about a second, and then open them. Do this at least 20 times, and then move on to the next exercise!<br />- Focusing on a certain side will help your eye muscles become stronger and ensure their good work. Don't overdo it, though! Performing this exercise once or twice a day is more than enough to keep your eyes healthy.<br />- You can do the eye bounce exercise while standing up, sitting, or even lying down! All you have to do is move your eyes up and down quickly about 10 times. When you’re done, rest for about a minute. Then repeat the exercise but with your eyes closed this time.<br />- This exercise is kinda self-explanatory: You have to sit straight, look in front of you, and trace a path as if you're drawing a giant 8 with your eyes on the wall in front of you. Don't cheat by moving your head — only your eyes should work here. Repeat this exercise about 5 times, and then go on with your day!<br />- Make sure you’re sitting straight, and tilt your head back a little bit. In this position, close your eyes, and place your index and middle fingers on your eyelids. Move the fingers of your right hand in a counterclockwise direction and the fingers of your left hand in a clockwise direction. Do this for about a minute, change directions, and repeat for one more minute.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
