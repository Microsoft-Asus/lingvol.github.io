.. ready for a KILLER routine? on a positive note: it's only 10 minutes &amp; the music is amazing! ♥︎ / Werbung<br /><br />I know, we have a love-hate relationship to my 15min HIIT workout. Me too, I admit that. <br />A 10min routine was definitely missing on my channel! Still a killer, still burning lots of calories, still breaking a sweat.. but: it's only 10 minutes :D <br /><br />This workout is:<br />1. FILLED WITH BASICS. <br />Nothing too fancy, nothing too dancy. Ask your male partner to join! They won't need to shake their hips for this one.<br />2. a mix out of &quot;QUICK MOVEMENTS&quot; and &quot;ACTIVE BREAKS&quot;.  <br />You will find Dolphin Holds &amp; Planks in between all the quick movements. Almost feels like a break, but don't forget to keep the core strength :D<br />3. HIGH ENERGY. <br />For some reason it doesn't drag me down - but rather gives me MORE energy! Might also be the music though.<br /><br />by the way: NO LUNGES. <br /><br />__<br /><br />If you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink &amp; continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself. <br /><br />▸ Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-130 kcal. <br />I burned about 80kcal in those 10min (which is a lot for me, I'm a small human and I normally burn about 250kcal in a 1h session). <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
