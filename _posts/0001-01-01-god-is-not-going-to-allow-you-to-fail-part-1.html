#JerrySavelle #FavorOfGod #Victory <br />God has many promises in His Word assuring that He has designed a life of victory for the Believer, including the scripture in 2 Corinthians 12:9 which says, &quot;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness...&quot; However, most Christians today who love God are living below their level of victory that God wants for their lives. If God's grace is sufficient, why don't more of us walk in the fact that we're immune to failure? Dr. Jerry Savelle has a powerful series for you on how to raise your expectation in God to see victory in every area of your life, how to stand on the Word until your circumstances change, and how vital it is to develop a no-quit attitude if you're going to live a life free from failure.<br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />👍  Like us and subscribe to our channel <br /><br />⭐️  Visit our store to see our featured resources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jerrysavelle.org/store">https://www.jerrysavelle.org/store</a> ⭐️<br /><br />» Do you need prayer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jerrysavelle.org/prayer-request">https://www.jerrysavelle.org/prayer-request</a><br /><br />» Do you have a testimony you would like to share: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jerrysavelle.org/testimonies">https://www.jerrysavelle.org/testimonies</a><br /><br />» Become a partner with Jerry Savelle today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jerrysavelle.org/partnership">https://www.jerrysavelle.org/partnership</a><br /><br />» Support/Donate/Give: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jerrysavelle.org/store/giving">https://www.jerrysavelle.org/store/giving</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON:<br />Facebook ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jerrysavellemin">https://www.facebook.com/jerrysavellemin</a><br />Instagram ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jerrysavellemin">https://www.instagram.com/jerrysavellemin</a><br />Twitter ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jerrysavellemin">https://twitter.com/jerrysavellemin</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br />About Jerry Savelle<br />Dr. Savelle is the author of more than forty books, including his bestsellers, If Satan Can’t Steal Your Joy, He Can’t Keep Your Goods and Called to Battle, Destined To Win.
