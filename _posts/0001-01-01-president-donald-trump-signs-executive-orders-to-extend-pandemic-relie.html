President Donald Trump on Saturday signed a series of executive orders expanding coronavirus economic relief to Americans struggling during the pandemic. The controversial move is raising questions about whether the president can legally authorize these measures. CNBC's Eamon Javers reports.

However, there’s no guarantee workers will receive that money.<br /><br />Trump added that if re-elected in November, he would look to extend the deferral and “terminate” the tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare programs. <br /><br />The president’s orders also extend the weekly unemployment bonus at a reduced level of $400 per week, instead of the $600 per week federal unemployment insurance that was approved in March and expired at the end of July. Trump said states will need to cover 25% of the $400 weekly benefits. <br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a><br /> <br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
