In this video we look at the very under used strategy of betting on draws in the football/soccer market. Predicting draws can be a difficult process but with the aid of this video you will be able to pick matches that have a good chance of ending all square. By doing so you will be able to make profitable selection in the 1x2 betting market allowing you to build a healthy profit.<br />By using an increasing stakes method we can protect ourselves against long winless (or drawless) sequences by ensuring that when we do hit that draw our profits will be reinstated.<br />Please always practice good bankroll management and only bet what you are comfortable with losing.
