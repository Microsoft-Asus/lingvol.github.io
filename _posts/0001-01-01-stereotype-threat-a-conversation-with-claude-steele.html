One only has to turn on the television to view a plethora of stereotypes about people based on gender, race, religion, physical appearance, intelligenceâ€”the list goes on. Claude Steele, Dean for the School of Education at Stanford University, and his colleagues discovered that even when stereotypes are not uttered aloud, the phenomenon of stereotype threat, or the fear of confirming a negative stereotype, can be a stigma that affects attitudes and behaviors.
