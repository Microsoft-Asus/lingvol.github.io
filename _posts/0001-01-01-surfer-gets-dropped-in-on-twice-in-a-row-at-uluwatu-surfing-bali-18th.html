{% raw %}It's definitely getting quieter and quieter here in Bali, but some surfers are still not playing by the rules! If you've ever been dropped-in on twice in a row, then you'll definitely feel for the guy at 1:54.<br /><br />The surf has been good for a while now, with medium swells and very light winds, which are often coming out of the East or South East. It looks like that trend is continuing into next week, albeit with slightly smaller swells. <br /><br />This video features land and drone footage.
