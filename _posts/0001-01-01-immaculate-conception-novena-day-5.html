You are the glory of Jerusalem, you are the joy of Israel, you give honor to our people. You are the advocate of sinners. O Mary, Virgin most prudent, Mother most merciful, pray for us, intercede for us, with the Lord Jesus Christ.<br /><br />O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin prepared a worthy dwelling for your Son, grant, we pray, that, as you preserved her from every stain by virtue of the death of your Son, which you foresaw, so, through her intercession, we, too, may be cleansed and admitted to your presence. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.<br /><br />Day Five: Among Her Children<br />A Reading from the Writings of St. Maximilian Kolbe<br />The Immaculata descends on earth as a good Mother among her children, to help them save their souls. Thus, she desires the conversion and sanctification of all souls, without exception. In order to carry out that work, though, she uses the tools taken from among men, as we see in the apparitions [to Bernadette]. At any rate, those are extraordinary events.<br /><br />Most often, she urges the children who love her to cooperate with her in situaÂ­tions of normal everyday life. These same souls consecrated to her, live by her, often think of her, love her wholeheartedly, and endeavor to discern her desiresâ€”either voiced from her own lips, or offered to them in silent inner inspirations. They propÂ­agate thus her will, attracting an ever larger number of souls to ever more perfect knowledge and ever more ardent love toward her, and in her and through her, to ever deeper love toward the Divine Heart of Jesus.<br /><br />At all times, the Immaculata inspires thousands of such souls devoted to herÂ­self. Many of them also come together more or less closely with one another to serve their Lady even better, in concerted effort. For this reason, the associations that work exclusively for her are many and varied.  One of the youngest groups that aim to win souls over to the Immaculata and, through her, to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, is the Militia of the Immaculata. (KW 1323)<br /><br />Prayer Intention<br />For all unborn (preborn) children and their parents; for the protection of the sacredness of human life from conception to natural death.<br /><br />Day 5 Prayer:<br />O Lord, who, by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, did prepare a fitting dwelling for your Son, we beseech you that as by the foreseen death of your Son, you did preserve her from all stain of sin, grant that through her intercession, we may be favored with the granting of the grace that we seek for at this time... <br />State your intention here... )<br /><br />O Mary of the Immaculate Conception, Mother of Christ, you had influence with your Divine Son while upon this earth; you have the same influence now in heaven. Pray for us and obtain for us from him the granting of my petition if it be the Divine Will. <br />Amen.<br /><br />Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be<br /><br />O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to you, and for all those who do not have recourse to you, especially the enemies of Holy Church and all those recommended to you.<br /><br />Grace for Today<br />Eagerness to be attentive to inner inspirations and to work with others so as to radiate Our Ladyâ€™s presence in the world.<br /><br />Pray the Daily Closing Prayer: (sorry no more space)<br /><br />ðŸ’—ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’—ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’—ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’—<br />CREDITS: PRAYER: www.ewtn.com<br />militiaoftheimmaculata.com<br />Video Background: YT moving clouds<br />Pls. don't download this video and re-upload it on your YT channel or FB page.
