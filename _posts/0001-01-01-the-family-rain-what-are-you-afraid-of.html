Yea<br /><br />Does the sky look black for the time of day?<br />I'm more tight lipped than the CIA. <br />So hold my hand if you wanna play.<br />No death in the afterlife<br />No wreck left to rectify <br />No Christ left to crucify <br />What are you afraid of<br />No soul left to sacrifice<br />No youth left to euthanise <br />No Christ left to crucify<br />What are you afraid of?<br /><br />Are you afraid of the dark?<br />What lies beneath<br />I stick my tongue on the battery<br />Sixteen volts and I'm shattering<br /><br />Do your eyes look red for the time of day<br />I'm blood shot now but it goes away.<br />So hold my hand if you wanna stay <br /><br />No death in the afterlife<br />No wreck left to rectify <br />No Christ left to crucify <br />What are you afraid of<br />No soul left to sacrifice<br />No youth left to euthanise <br />No Christ left to crucify<br />What are you afraid of?
