10/13/2018 - It's high waters on the high iron! <br />Due to excessive heavy rains the past few weeks, the Mississippi River rose significantly, causing some pretty hefty flooding. Of course, this included the Davenport, Iowa riverfront, and along with it, the Canadian Pacific Davenport Sub. Over 1,000 feet of the mainline was completely submerged.<br />This didn't stop CP trains from powering through it.<br />At just more than a walking pace, 3 Canadian Pacific freight trains pushed through the floodwaters, creating an absolutely surreal sight to see. More info below the time-stamps*!<br />Please enjoy!<br /><br />(0:03) CP 475 - Kansas City, MO to St. Paul, MN:<br />1. CP ES44AC #8868<br />2. CP ES44AC #8743<br />3. (R-DPU) CP AC44CW #8521<br /><br />(9:34) CP 472 - Nahant, IA to Bensenville, IL<br />1. CP ES44AC #8727<br />2. CP AC44CW #8537<br /><br />(19:35) CP 474 - St Paul, MN to Kansas City, MO<br />1. CP AC44C6M #8021<br />2. (R-DPU) CP ES44AC #8933<br /><br /><br />*The trains that came through today had to be issued clearance from a track foreman before entering the water. Typically, the foremen would check the depth of the water before each train and then issue clearance along with the special orders for crossing the water. I believe the rule is trains can't cross with head-end power if the water is deeper than 18 inches. As deep as it looks in this video, I guess it wasn't breaking that threshold. Each train was instructed to cross at no more than 3 mph. On top of that, after any engines were completely through and out of the water, they were to stop and Idle in Notch 4 for 10 minutes to heat and dry the traction motors which are AC electrically powered. As dangerous as this maneuver could look to the common eye, rest assured, it was very well coordinated as was done and safely as railroading gets! <br /><br />The 2nd one - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGFhtjvg6vk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGFhtjvg6vk</a><br /><br />Instragram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jnarup24/">https://www.instagram.com/jnarup24/</a><br />Flickr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jcnarup513/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/jcnarup513/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.railpictures.net/photo/673806">http://www.railpictures.net/photo/673806</a><br /><br />Other Railfans - CNSD75I, iliketrainskid3985, CNP204, Tri State Rails<br /><br /><br />All footage Â©Runnin' Eight.
