{% raw %}King of the tyrant lizards. It's 6 meters tall (20 feet), 12 meters (40 feet) long, and it weighs upward of seven tons. You can hide from it, you might even be able to outrun it, but do you really want to do this every day? What would it be like to live with T. rex? Would we keep them in zoos? Would we eat them in restaurants? Would we wear them on our backs? Or would we live in constant fear of being chomped, clawed, or trampled?<br /><br />Transcript and sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whatifshow.com/what-if-t-rex-were-still-alive/">https://whatifshow.com/what-if-t-rex-were-still-alive/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our second channel called &quot;How to Survive&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/how-to-survive-by-what-if">https://bit.ly/how-to-survive-by-what-if</a><br /><br />Can you translate this episode into another language?
