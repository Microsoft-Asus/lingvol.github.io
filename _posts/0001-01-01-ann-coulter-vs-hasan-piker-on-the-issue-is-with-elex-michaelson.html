A fiery debate by leading thinkers on both sides. <br /><br />Ann Coulter is a 13-time New York Times best selling author. Her latest book is called &quot;Resistance is Futile: How The Trump-Hating Left Lost It's Collective Mind.&quot;<br /><br />Hasan Piker is the youngest of the Young Turks. He's one of the most prominent progressive voices in social media. His posts have been seen and shared by millions. <br /><br />They debate the migrant caravan and how the U.S. should respond. <br /><br />They also discuss whether the President bears some responsibility for the recent bombings?
