For some of the newer deer hunters out there this video maybe of some value to them to see what I include in my backpack when I head out in the field. This is not all inclusive and the area and terrain will dictate what you need to take with you. But for the average day hunt on a farm or on some public property this will give you a good idea on what to pack and why. <br />Been hunting for a long time now and what you may have taken ten years ago my not apply to you now, but some are some standards that should be with you on every hunt. I also include some secondary items that may be kept in the car and may only be needed on occasion.  <br />The more you go out the more you will develop your on kit list, I hope that this will help some of our young hunters which are the future of our sport.<br /><br />Some of the items I included;<br />Hat, Gloves (spare), neck warmers, deer drag, rope, knife, towel, rubber or plastic gloves, hand warmers, license, food, coffee, <br />energy drinks, duck tape, chap stick, extra gloves, socks.<br /><br /><br />As far as the sunglasses go in the basement, was having trouble with some of my videos coming out looking yellowed due to the lack of light. I increased the amount of lights on the table (have outdoor spot lights shining down now). Was a little bright on the eyes, thus the sunglasses.
