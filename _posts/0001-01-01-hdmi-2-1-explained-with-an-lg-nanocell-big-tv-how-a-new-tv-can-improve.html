Thanks to LG for supplying the NanoCell 75NANO99: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lgnanocell.co/DigitalFoundry">https://lgnanocell.co/DigitalFoundry</a><br />With the arrival of PS5 and Xbox Series X, now's a good time to upgrade your TV. In this video, Rich describes the two key technologies in today's TV market - OLED and LCD - and the advantages and disadvantages of both. Also: how bigger is better in the living room, plus all of the key technologies delivered by HDMI 2.1 - 4K 120Hz, ALLM and perhaps the most crucial of all - VRR, variable refresh rate. Oh, and how about 8K? Yes, we look at that too, powered by the Asus ROG Strix RTX 3090.<br /><br />Thank you to Backtrace for sponsoring Digital Foundry and this video.
