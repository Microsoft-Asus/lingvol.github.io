Mojo Jojo's final starring role in the reboot: Brainlord. Not his final appearance, however, he actually shows up two more times before the end of the series so not to worry haha, we still have a bit more time left with him before he's gone for good. This episode in particular features him dressing up as an alien superhero and aiding the girls in defending Townsville, which in turn leads to them inviting him in as a member of the Utonium family.<br /><br />Something I just realized while writing this description that I don't mention in the video: this was another episode that could've integrated Bliss perfectly considering Mojo's backstory revolves around him coming from space. There was story potential there for sure, maybe with Bliss being skeptical of him for never hearing of his planet or something. Would've been cool to see, but I'll still take the episode we ultimately got.<br /><br />============<br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br />============<br />Be sure to follow me on Twitter for all the latest updates on videos and other various posts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ashadowstreak">https://twitter.com/ashadowstreak</a><br /><br />Want your name in my videos?
