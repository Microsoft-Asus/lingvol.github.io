Remember that your personal results from this workout will vary based on your age, height, weight and current fitness level. Please also consult with your doctor first before beginning any new fitness workout or program.<br /><br /><br />*Routine Intensity Level Key*<br />Level 1 : Low-Moderate Intensity; slow-moderate paced movements (usually a warm up or a cool down routine). You should be able to talk during this intensity level. <br />Level 2: Moderate-High Intensity; fast paced movements; talking is more difficult as heart rate is higher.<br />Level 3: High-Very Vigorous intensity; strenuous and fast paced movements that are maintained and even increased throughout the routine; can’t say more than a few words because you are getting breathless. <br /><br />*Some routines may be listed as in between two levels.
