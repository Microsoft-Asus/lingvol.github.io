I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the fountain of the water of life without payment. 7 He who conquers shall have this heritage, and I will be his God and he shall be my son.<br /><br />Revelation 22:17<br /><br />17 The Spirit and the Bride say, &quot;Come.&quot; And let him who hears say, &quot;Come.&quot; And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price.{% endraw %}
