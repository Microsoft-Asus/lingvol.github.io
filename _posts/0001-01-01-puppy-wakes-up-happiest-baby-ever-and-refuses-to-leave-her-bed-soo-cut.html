Amelia is the world's happiest baby! She always wakes up with a smile and positive nature, even though she's been woken up haha. Teddy was very tired after a long day so although he was happy to see her, all he wanted to do was sleep beside her. When it came time to getting out, Teddy wouldn't leave and had to be air lifted out  then he just tried to snooze straight away again!  Those baby sleepy heads sure are comfortable though!  Have you ever known a baby to wake up like this?? Straight away she is inquisitive and alert, it's a strange concept for us, we hate mornings haha. <br /><br />Thanks for watching guys, hope you enjoyed it xx<br /><br />Shop our 2021 calendars <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.createphotocalendars.com/storelifewithmalamutes-6949239121">https://www.createphotocalendars.com/storelifewithmalamutes-6949239121</a><br /> <br />Shop our Teespring Merchandise <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/life-with-malamutes">https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/life-with-malamutes</a><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram too! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lifewithmalamutes/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/lifewithmalamutes/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook and like our page!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lifewithmalamutes/">https://www.facebook.com/lifewithmalamutes/</a><br /><br />Intro design by @georgia_allison<br />www.illustrationsbyher.com
