'Fairground' performed live in Cuba in 2005.<br /><br />Here in concert at the Gran Teatro, whether alone in the spotlight or sharing the stage in carnival fashion with native Cuban players and classically but newly liberated dancers, Mick Hucknall and Simply Red deliver an inarguable truth: they are one of Britain's best ever bands, and this is them at their finest.
