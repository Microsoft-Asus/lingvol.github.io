It will soon be easier and cheaper for South Africans to emigrate to Mauritius from this month, says property group Chas Everitt International.<br /><br />As part of its coronavirus budget on 4 June, the government announced a number of incentives to encourage foreigners to live, work and invest in Mauritius.<br /><br />In line with new government measures introduced, the minimum investment required to acquire an occupation permit (OP) as an investor, and live in Mauritius as a non-citizen, has been halved to $50,000 (R867,000), from $100,000 (R1.7 million).
