Together, these form an x-shape across the front of the body and wrap around the upper back, connecting each hip to the opposite shoulder. <br /><br />Tapping into the serape effect is what allows a martial artist to deliver a kick with a literal *ton* of force, or a baseball pitcher to throw a ball at over 100mph!<br /><br />This video explains more about what the serape effect is and how to train it. I also talk about the stretch-shortening cycle, and how these concepts can work in tandem.
