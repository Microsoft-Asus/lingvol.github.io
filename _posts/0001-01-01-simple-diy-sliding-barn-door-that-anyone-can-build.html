We are so excited to show you not only how easy the process is to build these DIY rustic barn doors but how amazing the end result is!<br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while we building our own off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life. <br />#off grid{% endraw %}
