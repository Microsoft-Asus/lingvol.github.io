{% raw %}♛ People  Are Awesome ☀ 2020 ♫ ALL OVER THE WORLD<br />Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are a British rock group from Birmingham, England, who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.<br /><br />Despite early singles success in the United Kingdom, the band were initially more successful in the United States, billed as &quot;The English guys with the big fiddles&quot;. They soon gained a cult following despite lukewarm reviews back in their native United Kingdom. By the mid-1970s, they had become one of the biggest-selling acts in music. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 Top-40 hit singles in both the UK and the US. The group also scored 20 Top 20 UK hit singles, as well as 15 Top-20 hit singles in the US (as charted by Billboard magazine). The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits of any group in US chart history without ever having a number one single.<br /><br />ELO collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA and 38 BPI awards, and sold over 50 million records worldwide during the group's active period of recording and touring.<br /><br />Jeff Lynne -- lead vocals, guitars, bass guitar, keyboards, drums, cello, producer, songwriter, composer, arranger (1970--1983, 1985--1986, 2000--2001, 2012)<br />Bev Bevan -- drums, percussion, vocals (1970--1983, 1985--1986)<br />Roy Wood -- lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar, cello, clarinet, bassoon, oboe, drums, recorder, producer, songwriter, arranger (1970--72)<br />Bill Hunt -- keyboards, French horn, hunting horn (1970--1972)<br />Steve Woolam -- violin (1970--1971)<br />Richard Tandy -- keyboards, synthesisers, bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals, arranger (1972--1983, 1985--1986, 2000--2001, 2012)<br />Mike Edwards -- cello (1972--1974)<br />Wilfred Gibson -- violin (1972--1973)<br />Hugh McDowell -- cello (1972, 1973--1979)<br />Andy Craig -- cello (1972)<br />Colin Walker -- cello (1972--1973)<br />Mike de Albuquerque -- bass guitar, backing vocals (1972--1974)<br />Mik Kaminski -- violin (1973--1979, 1981--1983, 1986)<br />Louis Clark -- orchestra arranger, conductor, synthesisers, keyboards (1974--1981, 1983--1986)<br />Kelly Groucutt -- bass guitar, backing vocals (1974--1983)<br />Melvyn Gale -- cello, piano (1975--1979)<br />Dave Morgan -- backing vocals, synthesisers, acoustic guitar (1981--1986)<br />Martin Smith -- bass guitar, backing vocals (1986)<br />Marc Mann -- guitars, keyboards, backing vocals (2000--2001, 2012)<br />Matt Bissonette -- bass guitar, backing vocals (2001)<br />Gregg Bissonette -- drums, backing vocals (2001)<br />Peggy Baldwin -- cello (2001)<br />Sarah O'Brien -- cello (2001)<br />Rosie Vela -- backing vocals (2001)<br /><br />Studio albumsThe Electric Light Orchestra (1971)<br />ELO 2 (1973)<br />On the Third Day (1973)<br />Eldorado (1974)<br />Face the Music (1975)<br />A New World Record (1976)<br />Out of the Blue (1977)<br />Discovery (1979)<br />Xanadu (1980)<br />Time (1981)<br />Secret Messages (1983)<br />Balance of Power (1986)<br />Zoom (2001){% endraw %}
