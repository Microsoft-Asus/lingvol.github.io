Mercy’s drive to form Wild Diversity came from the desire to support a robust community of POC &amp; Queer outdoorists and be an architect of much needed change for diversity in the outdoor industry. She wanted a welcoming and safe place for her underrepresented communities to thrive. Mercy has over 15 years in community leadership as an educator and facilitator directly serving community. She has also traveled to over a dozen countries training and leading workshops as a roller derby coach to empower women to realize their potential. She brings that passion to the Wild Diversity community and is proud to be a part of community growth.
