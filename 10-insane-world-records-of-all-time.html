One of those things is, of course, the idea of breaking a world record. Wouldn’t it be cool to one day find your name on the Book of Guinness World Records? It would be awesome! All you need is some courage and determination. However, some things are better left the way they are, and some of these records might be things that you’d never want to try. Today we’ll be looking at “10 Guinness World Records that Can’t Be Broken” - or well, you could try -- but I doubt many people out there would dare to give these a try. You’ll be surprised when you see what “Number 1” had to do in order to make it to this list. And trust me, it’s not a thing you’d like to consider.<br /><br />Heaviest Weight Supported by a Human Tongue<br /><br />What's the heaviest food you've eaten? That's a question no one really asks. Because usually, when we eat, we never really think about the weight of food. But things are a bit different for Thomas Blackthorne, who lifted 11 kilos worth of weight with...his tongue! That's right. He had his tongue pierced by a hook that was able to hold 4 weights. He lifted those 11 kilos with the strength of his tongue and held them for about 5 seconds, without getting hurt. It took him six years to prepare for this moment, and it doesn't seem like anyone will ever be able to challenge him. He broke the record in 2004 and since then, the only person who's been able to take on the challenge is Thomas Blackthorne himself. He went on again and broke the record three times in a row!<br /><br />Most One Handed Push Ups<br /><br />Workouts require a lot of discipline and determination in order to get us good results. And if you want to break a world record that involves a workout...then you're in for a lot of sweating, sore muscles and lots of pain. However, that didn't stop athlete Paddy Doyle from setting a few records that are now hard to break. One of the most impressive of them all is &quot;most one-arm push ups completed in five hours.&quot; <br /><br />Who comes up with these record ideas, anyway? Doyle managed to get 5,260 push ups, which means that he did a little more than 1,000 of them for every hour that he was there. In addition to such an odd accomplishment, he also managed to become the person to set the record for the most push-ups in a year, with a total of one million and five hundred thousand and two hundred and thirty push-ups from October, 1988 to October of 1989. The list of accomplishments goes on, as he also set records in other disciplines such as sit ups, step ups, burpees and backpack running. The man is a legend and certainly, an inspiration for all of those who are into health and fitness. <br /><br />Most Atomic Blast Survived<br /><br />I guess it's quite obvious why no one will ever be able to break this record! I mean, it would require a tragic event to happen and we certainly don't want that. But Tsutomu Yamaguchi fairly gained a spot on this list by being the man who survived the most atomic blasts in a lifetime. In two different occasions, Mr. Yamaguchi was able to escape death and lived longer to tell his story. In the summer of 1945, he had traveled to Hiroshima when the first atomic bombing happened.  The explosion left him temporarily blind, and with serious burns and ruptured eardrums. But that didn't keep him from going back to work in Nagasaki, only three days later after the incident. He was reporting to his supervisors when the Fat Man atomic bomb impacted their city. This time, however, Mr. Yamaguchi didn't get hurt. In 2009, Yamaguchi became the only person in Japan to be recognized as a survivor of both bombings. He passed away at the age of 93 in the year 2010, but he spent his life advocating to stop the use of atomic and nuclear bombing. Hopefully, no one has to go through this ever again.<br /><br />Pulling an Airplane<br /><br />What would you say to people who claim that they are able to move an airplane by simply using their strength? You'd probably think they're crazy. And that's exactly how people felt back in 2009 when Priest Kevin Fast told them that he was going to pull an airplane. He was able to do it over the length of 8.8 meters and he even claims that he could have gone a bit further if there hadn't been a finish line. Over the years, he has been able to break a few world records with the use of his strength. He has used the money he raises from his stunts to go to charities. With the airplane event, he was able to make 65,000 dollars!
